2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 1. 
Letter from our Chairman and CEO. 
The past few years have accelerated change in many facets of our lives—how we work and do business, how we communicate and what we prioritize and value.
They have also sparked a renewed urgency to tackle the problems facing society on a global scale, including the 1.4 billion individuals currently left out of the formal financial system, the continuing effects of a lingering pandemic and the real world consequences of climate change.
There is no overstating the seriousness of the challenges before us. Urgent problems demand urgent solutions.
As global citizens, we at Visa are committed to making a positive impact in the world through living out our purpose: to uplift everyone, everywhere by being the best way to pay and be paid. We strive to do this in our efforts to empower small businesses and local economies, secure the channels of commerce, protect the planet, invest in and diversify our workforce, and operate ethically, responsibly and sustainably.
At Visa, digital payments is our business. With studies showing that even a small increase in the rate of digital adoption can have an outsized influence on a country’s. 
GDP—particularly developing countries—we are leaning into our strengths, digitally enabling communities around the world. We have made great strides to bring the power of digital payments to a growing number of small and micro businesses. We’ve also invested in improving digital literacy and financial education in communities across our regions through initiatives including Practical Money Skills, which reached over 3.2 million people and was offered in 48 countries and 19 languages in 2021.
To help ensure the digital economy is a safe and convenient place for businesses of all sizes to operate, we continue to invest in the security of our network and the broader ecosystem, including our investment of over $9 billion in fraud protection over the past five years. In 2021, Visa’s security efforts contributed to preventing $26 billion in fraud-related losses.
Within Visa, we continue to focus on enhancing the talent experience for underrepresented groups. In the United States, we made progress toward our Stand Together goals, including our goals to increase underrepresented communities within our workforce. We also announced our Black Scholars and. 
Jobs program — a scholarship, mentorship, internship and job placement program aimed at supporting a pipeline of diverse future leaders in the business and technology sectors.
Building on our achievements in sustainable operations — 100% renewable electricity use and carbon neutral operations — we continue to work toward a more sustainable economy.
We are expanding our commercial offerings that help our clients and their customers access sustainable payment features and shift towards more sustainable behaviors— including through expanding digital payments acceptance in 
public transit systems and electric vehicle charging networks and launching the Visa Eco Benefits bundle to help Visa cardholders better understand the environmental impact of their day-to-day payments.
These accomplishments are grounded in our commitment to run our company ethically, responsibly and sustainably.
This, together with strong, independent governance, contributes to our ability to be a leader in our industry in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance.
We are proud to be recognized for our efforts, including our continued inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability North. 
America Index and once again being named to the World’s. 
Most Ethical Companies and Most JUST Companies lists.
As I reflect on the results across our ESG areas of focus, I recognize that, although we have done much good for the world, much remains to be done. The work ahead is challenging, but I believe we have the best and the brightest talent in payments. As we continue to live out our purpose, the positive impact we can make only grows.
In the following pages, I invite you to learn more about the work we do, day in and day out, to advance a more prosperous and sustainable future for all.
Sincerely,
Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa

Our Environmental, Social & Governance Approach. 
Visa is committed to operating as a responsible, ethical, inclusive and sustainable company. As a global leader in digital payments, Visa strives to join with clients, partners and other stakeholders to empower people, businesses and communities to thrive. We focus on mitigating risk and creating value across priority environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in five clusters: • Empowering People, Communities & Economies • Securing Commerce & Protecting Customers • Investing in Our People • Protecting the Planet • Operating Responsibly. 
ESG Oversight. 
Visa believes in the importance of strong layers of governance to ensure proper guidance and oversight is provided across our approach to ESG.
ESG activities are managed at a functional level across our strategic and operational areas, with executive and Board oversight. Visa’s Chief Sustainability Officer is responsible for leading the coordination of oversight and development of our global ESG efforts. At the management level, a cross-functional group of more than a dozen senior leaders contributes to coordinating our ESG strategy and reporting efforts.
1 In this report, our use of the terms “material,” “materiality” and other similar terms refers to materiality within the context of our ESG programs and priorities. We are not using these terms as they are used under the securities or other laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of financial statements and financial reporting.
At the Board level, the Nominating and Corporate Governance. 
Committee has formal responsibility to oversee and review our management of ESG matters, overall ESG strategy, stakeholder engagement, formal reporting, and policies and programs in specific areas, including environmental sustainability, climate change, human rights, political activities and expenditures, social impact and philanthropy.
In 2021, the Board, in full and in individual committees, discussed a range of ESG topics, including human capital management, inclusion and diversity, climate strategy, political contributions and technology – including information security and cybersecurity.
Materiality1. 
To inform our ESG strategy, we conduct a biennial materiality assessment in accordance with best practice ESG reporting guidelines. Our latest assessment, completed in 2021, incorporates and reflects recent business developments,
ESG trends, global regulatory changes and internal and external stakeholder expectations that have emerged since our last formal assessment in 2019. Our process includes benchmarking, identification, prioritization and validation of. 
ESG topics. We review direct feedback from shareholders, employee surveys and customer and client information requests on ESG topics.

ESG-Linked Compensation. 
The compensation program for our named executive officers (NEOs) promotes retention and rewards performance that enhances stockholder value and drives long-term strategic outcomes, including the Company’s broader ESG efforts.
There are four primary principles that guide our NEO compensation program design and administration: • Pay for performance • Alignment with stakeholders’ interests • Variation based on performance • Motivation and retention of key talent. 
For FY21, the Board developed a scorecard approach for annual bonuses. In the scorecard, ESG goals are included alongside financial, client and other goals that are all critical to our corporate strategy and our long-term success. The. 
Board reviews Visa’s performance relative to all the goals in the scorecard, including ESG goals, when determining NEO bonuses for the year.
In FY21, the annual bonus scorecard included, among other topics, goals related to digital enablement of small and micro businesses; environment and climate initiatives; employee participation in social impact programs; inclusion and diversity initiatives; and employee wellbeing programs.

Empowering People, Communities & Economies 9


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 10. 
Visa is committed to advancing inclusive, equitable and sustainable economic growth for everyone, everywhere.
We are focused on reaching people who have been traditionally underserved, providing them with access to resources that can help improve their economic livelihoods, businesses and communities.
Our priorities include: • Small and micro business • Digital equity and inclusion • Community support. 
Small & Micro Business. 
According to the UN, micro-, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs or SMBs) account for 90 percent of businesses, 60 percent to 70 percent of employment and 50 percent of GDP worldwide, making them a vital contributor to the world’s economy.
In 2020, we announced a global commitment to digitally enable 50 million small and micro businesses by the end of 2023. To accomplish this goal, we are introducing a range of locally designed programs and solutions that include building online businesses, increasing the acceptance of digital payments and incentivizing neighborhood support.
Solutions. 
We continue to develop products to advance digital equity and economic empowerment, including:
Visa Acceptance Cloud. 
A next-generation cloud-based acceptance platform providing a point-of-sale (POS) solution that allows business owners to convert any Internet-connected device to a POS device, enabling access to a low-cost and scalable payments solution.
Visa Direct. 
A payment solution that helps businesses and individuals move money between billions of cards and accounts worldwide. Businesses can use Visa Direct through their financial institutions to deliver fast, simple and efficient payments to customers and workers. Individuals can use. 
Visa Direct to pay others back, send gifts, share costs and support families around the world.
Scan to Pay. 
A Quick Response code-based mobile payment solution that allows users to send payments directly from a. 
Visa prepaid, debit or credit card account to a range of merchants and businesses using just a mobile phone. Scan to Pay expands payment options for consumers without requiring merchant investment in specialized hardware.

Visa has helped to digitally enable 30.7 million SMBs worldwide, on track to achieve our goal of 50 million SMBs by 20231 1 As of May 2022


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 11. 
Skills. 
Visa’s Practical Business Skills educational portal houses free resources and interactive tools to help business owners start, manage and grow their small businesses. The program is focused on helping growth-minded entrepreneurs with fewer than ten employees thrive via a variety of resources. In 2021, we expanded the program globally and offer resources in English, Spanish, French and Arabic.
Visa has also built localized online resources in more than 20 countries to provide tools, partner offers and information on starting, running and growing digital-first small businesses.
Partnerships & Initiatives. 
Complementing our support of solutions and skills, Visa develops partnerships and initiatives in support of SMBs.
Recognizing that greater digitization of commerce can bring enormous benefits to small businesses, Visa’s efforts are focused on helping to ensure both existing and newly minted small businesses are well-equipped to meet changing consumer demands and embrace the digital future.
Inclusive Fintech 50. 
Visa is a founding supporter of the Inclusive Fintech 50, (IF50), which promotes early-stage fintechs driving inclusion and resilience for financially underserved people.
Companies identified through the initiative offer solutions among payments and remittances, savings and personal financial management, infrastructure addressing special challenges of underserved customer segments, credit or 1As of the 2022 competition cycle insurance. IF50 aims to make these startups more visible to investors and partners who can provide capital and connections.
Over the last three competitions, IF50 has attracted over 1,000 eligible applicants. Past winners have collectively increased their funding by $620 million in the year following their win. Winners benefit from access to zero-cost tools such as Visa’s Practical Business Skills and. 
Practical Money Skills.
Visa Everywhere Initiative (VEI)
VEI is a global innovation program that tasks startups to solve payment challenges of tomorrow, further enhance their own product propositions and provide visionary solutions for Visa’s network of partners.
The program first launched in the U.S. in 2015. Since then, VEI has engaged 8,500 startups in more than 100 countries. Collectively, these startups have raised over $16 billion in funding.1. 
VEI is committed to supporting diversity in the startup community as a platform for brilliant innovators of all races, ethnicities, ages, genders and sexual orientations.
For example, in 2021 we partnered with StartOut to help shine a spotlight on remarkable LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs.
National Football League (NFL)
As the official payment services technology partner of the. 
NFL, Visa ran a season-long commitment to support small businesses as part of its partnership with the NFL. Visa teamed up with several teams to give away grants totaling $60,000 to support Black-owned small businesses in and around New York City and Santa Clara, California that have been impacted by COVID-19.
Visa Economic Empowerment Institute. 
In 2020, we launched the Visa Economic. 
Empowerment Institute (VEEI), an independent, non- partisan center of excellence for research and public- private dialogue on payments policy. The VEEI’s overarching mission is to promote public policies that empower citizens, small businesses and economies.
It develops new research and insights to inform long- term policy within the global payments ecosystem.
Visa established VEEI as the next step in our ongoing mission to remove barriers to economic empowerment and to create more inclusive, equitable economic opportunities for everyone, everywhere.
A team of fellows, composed of subject matter experts in payments, development finance, international trade, cybersecurity and other key issues, apply Visa’s global insights and expertise to help governments create more inclusive digital economies. The three focus areas of the VEEI are fostering digital equity and inclusion, unlocking growth through trade and imagining an open future for payments.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 12. 
Digital Equity & Inclusion. 
Communities and economies thrive when all individuals are included in the formal financial system and can benefit from financial and digital access. Our initiatives and partnerships focus on helping to enable equitable access to the financial and digital ecosystem for everyone, everywhere.
The following section provides illustrative examples of how. 
Visa continues to support digital equity and inclusion.
Financial Education. 
Greater financial knowledge can empower people to better manage their money and improve their quality of life. Our award-winning global financial literacy initiative, Practical. 
Money Skills, strives to link consumers, educators, banks and governments to the tools and resources they need, helping individuals and communities develop their money management skills.
Practical Money Skills programs have now been offered in 48 countries and 19 languages and reached more than 3.2 million individuals during 2021.
Government Disbursements. 
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased need for government disbursement programs that enable quick and efficient distribution of financial support to people in need.
1 Actual fund availability varies by receiving financial institution, receiving account type, region and whether the transaction is domestic or cross-border. 
Visa worked with governments to reach individuals without bank accounts and encourage people to spend locally and help stimulate economic recovery.
Visa Government Prepaid is an electronic disbursement method that replaces paper checks for disbursement of government benefits (such as Unemployment Insurance,
Child Support and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families).
For benefit recipients, especially those without a banking relationship, Visa Government Prepaid cards provide a safer alternative to carrying cash and checks and are a convenient way to receive government disbursements.
Gig & Hourly Workers. 
Visa continues to develop new services and work with external partners to support gig and hourly workers as the gig economy grows. Visa and our Earned Wage Access technology partners help accelerate payments to workers through Visa Direct, enabling workers to access and transfer earned wages to their bank accounts or eligible debit cards in real time, rather than after the typical two- week pay cycle.1. 
In 2021, we continued supporting gig workers through previously established programs and partnerships, including with DailyPay, FlexWage, Instant Financial,
PayActiv, Wagestream and ZayZoon.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 13. 
Women’s Economic Empowerment. 
Expanding women's inclusion in the financial system has significant economic benefits. Our goal is to increase the number of women who control capital, the number of women entrepreneurs who can access that capital and the number of women who benefit from those businesses as employees or customers.
Visa’s support of women’s economic empowerment includes the following examples:
She’s Next. 
The challenges that women entrepreneurs face are universal.
Together, Visa in collaboration with IFundWomen, have been creating access to funding and education for women-owned small businesses around the world through the Visa She’s. 
Next Grant Program.

Payments Security. 
Visa’s ecosystem is a network of networks that enables participants to move money for everyone, everywhere.
For payments security, we are committed to making our ecosystem the most secure, resilient and trusted engine of commerce. We continuously scan the ecosystem to identify and invest in new capabilities, work with clients to help secure the environment and take action to improve the security, integrity and resiliency of our network.
We invest in innovation to build and maintain trust for our network and the broader payments ecosystem.
Specifically, we have invested approximately $9 billion in cybersecurity over the past five years, with about $500 million of that specifically allocated to data and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. We continue to evolve our security capabilities and work to lower our global fraud rate, which is at an all-time low of $0.07 for every $100 in payment volume on our network.
The Visa Intelligent Security framework offers our ecosystem partners dynamic, data-rich solutions that help balance fraud reduction and dispute prevention. Our aim is to increase approvals so that businesses can thrive while customers are protected and satisfied — no matter where or how they are paid or pay.
The Intelligent Security framework spans the entire transaction lifecycle:
Onboarding & Management. 
Provide financial institutions with tools to identify identity fraud at account opening. Through our financial institution clients, we provide tools to manage security, including account use restrictions and customizable alerts.
Consumer Identity & Authentication. 
Apply artificial intelligence-powered authentication strategies to prevent unauthorized access to Visa accounts.
Transaction Authorization. 
Use tools such as Visa Advanced Authorization, which applies real-time AI and machine learning to evaluate the trustworthiness of transactions to prevent fraud without inconveniencing consumers.
Dispute Management. 
Help consumers and issuers proactively address transaction disputes with Visa tools such as Verifi, which provides issuers and customers access to transaction information from sellers via a global data-sharing network.
Performance Optimization. 
Enhance payment performance by reducing fraud and increasing efficiency.
We continue to work with clients across different regions to meet their unique needs and accelerate the adoption of these solutions.
We measure the effectiveness of our approach to payments security on an ongoing basis. We monitor metrics such as fraud rates for Card Present and Card. 
Not Present scenarios as well as transaction volumes that leverage secure technologies, such as 3-D Secure or Tokenization. Additionally, we implement capability roadmaps for digitalization and automation. We improve the operational resilience of our network by engaging with ecosystem participants to gather perspectives, benchmark our thinking and approach and steer our security investments.
Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager used AI and machine learning to help reduce fraud by $26B in 2021.

AI-Powered Innovations for Smarter Payments. 
Visa is leveraging AI to improve our customer experience and enhance processes that enable the movement of billions of dollars across thousands of institutions in more than 200 countries and territories and 160 currencies. In February 2021,
Visa announced VisaNet +AI, a suite of AI-powered services that enhance predictability, transparency and speed in the payment experience. VisaNet +AI includes Visa Smarter Posting and Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, as well as Visa. 
Smarter Stand-In Processing (STIP).
Smarter Posting. 
When a restaurant-goer adds a tip, or when a cross-border payment involves multiple currencies, the amount authorized in real time at checkout can differ from the amount eventually cleared from a consumer’s account. Banks often delay posting the payment or updating the account balance until they have certainty about the final amount. To help issuers create a better banking experience for cardholders, Visa developed Smarter Posting, a service that uses AI to deliver a customized score for each transaction as part of the authorization process. The Smarter Posting model analyzes transaction details and historical data to predict the likelihood that a transaction amount will remain consistent through clearing.
Smarter Settlement Forecast. 
As the final step in the payment cycle, transactions are aggregated, transfers are facilitated between acquirers and issuers, and merchant accounts are credited for completed sales. Visa created Smarter Settlement Forecast to provide financial institution clients with customized 7-day forecasts of the settlement amount they may need on hand each day. The service uses information generated by historical settlement volumes, seasonal indicators, macro-trends, outlier events and real-time transaction data to provide high-quality predictions of cash outflows and inflows.
Smarter Stand-In Processing. 
Smarter STIP uses deep learning to help financial institutions increase transaction authorizations during outages.
Smarter STIP generates an informed decision to approve or decline transactions on behalf of issuers to provide consumers with a frictionless Visa payment experience.

Cybersecurity at Visa. 
Recognizing that the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, Visa is committed to championing cybersecurity within our operations.
We use an established risk assessment methodology and framework to identify cybersecurity risks and associated business impacts. Over the past several years, Gartner. 
Consulting assessed Visa’s security posture and assigned. 
Visa its highest rating among peer companies for the overall maturity of our cybersecurity program.
At Visa, we build and use AI to detect and secure cyber threats. We approach cybersecurity with a layered defense-in-depth strategy. We further advance our capabilities based on our core areas of focus, including enhancing our architecture, expanding our data security program to include unstructured data and conducting continuous security and efficacy efforts. Visa developers build security into applications with the very first lines of code. We augment our core detection capabilities with a proactive approach, where we “hunt” for traces of malicious activity to intercept would-be attackers.
Visa uses novel innovation in the new field of behavior biometrics coupled with the economics of vendor offerings to champion the development of AI products that support cybersecurity. Our cybersecurity team develops solutions in-house to meet our stringent security requirements. Customized Visa-engineered solutions include Visa Behavior Analytics and the Self-
Defending Platform.
Visa Behavior Analytics defends against digital identity fraud by providing strong consumer authentication. By building our own products, we keep cybersecurity data in-house, compared to previous models which outsourced data to a black-box model.
Visa also makes year-over-year investments to improve our cybersecurity capabilities. We continue to implement new technologies and processes to enhance our security posture against emerging threats.
No single technology in isolation can stop every threat.
We deploy multiple redundant layers of preventative and detective technologies across our network and data layers.
In the rare event cyber criminals succeed in breaching one layer, the doors beyond that layer are locked. We collaborate and share our security approach with industry peers, clients and competitors.
Our cybersecurity approach is supported by robust governance processes which involve regular reporting to management- and Board-level committees responsible for risk management and cybersecurity oversight. We provide regular updates to the full Board, including an annual in-depth review.
The following sections describe some of the components we use to enact our cybersecurity strategy across the business.
Policy & Training. 
Visa’s cybersecurity policy framework, the Key Controls, details our approach to protecting our information and technology assets, including the safe handling of consumer nonpublic personal information. The Key. 
Controls are reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to address any changes to industry or regulatory requirements, new technologies or emerging threats.
We provide new employees with security awareness training and conduct annual Key Controls training for all staff, to promote good cyber-hygiene and familiarity with. 
Visa processes and tools. In 2021, 100% percent of eligible employees completed Key Controls training. Additionally,
Visa Cybersecurity has launched an e-curriculum of online training modules covering such topics as Phishing, Data. 
Security, Security Assessment and more.
We publish cybersecurity awareness content to employees across multiple enterprise channels throughout the year. These include intranet pages dedicated to various topics such as phishing prevention and secure file transfer, periodic blog articles covering seasonal threats and relevant tips, such as secure remote working, executive announcements on key themes and instructor-led training and speaker sessions.
Each October, Visa celebrates Cybersecurity Awareness. 
Month with a month-long, multi-channel messaging campaign, including online articles, training modules, speaker sessions and additional online content.

We regularly conduct cross-functional response and resiliency exercises involving multiple internal teams as well as external partners and agencies.
In 2021, we further evolved the Visa Cyber Fusion. 
Framework to drive an active and adaptive global Cyber. 
Defense capability. This capability allows us to scale to meet the increasing threat landscape through the ability to rapidly collect, analyze and use cyber threat intelligence while providing continuous real-time validation of our security tools and assets. We augment our data with intelligence from hundreds of unique sources to enhance detection and response capabilities.
We also leverage AI and deep learning technology to monitor our network and understand the threats aimed at our company. As cybersecurity risks continue to develop, we are focused on maintaining our security posture ahead of the evolving threat landscape. We strengthened our supply chain by completing additional risk assessments. Our efforts to mitigate risks, including malware attacks, data breaches and phishing scams, focus on continuous cybersecurity threat identification.
Audits & Third-Party Certifications. 
To promote the effectiveness of our cybersecurity approach and systems, we conduct annual internal and external audits of our IT infrastructure and applications.
These systems also are subject to examination by the. 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and other regulators from across the globe. Examples of external reviews include: Payment Card Industry Data. 
Security Standard, Statement on Standards for Attestation. 
Engagements (SSAE-18) and International Standard on. 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402.
In addition, we are subject to privacy and data security laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the. 
European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Data Privacy. 
At Visa, building trust begins with a commitment to privacy and security, which instills confidence in our employees and clients, protects our brand and allows us to innovate responsibly. We believe consumers expect convenience, security and privacy from their payment experiences.
To meet these expectations, Visa makes the following commitments: • We adhere to high ethical and legal standards everywhere we operate.
• We do not sell personal information. Our Global Privacy. 
Notice describes how we share information, such as when we process payments, provide services to card issuers, prevent fraud or with a cardholder’s consent.
• We use personal information only for defined, appropriate purposes. In addition to operating one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks, we provide authentication, fraud management, loyalty, consulting and data processing services. We also create data products that give our clients insights into their business performance. These products contain data that is de-identified to protect consumer privacy.
• We support our commitments with a dedicated global privacy program, employee training and rigorous assessments.
At Visa, we have accountable executives and hundreds of dedicated security, privacy and data professionals working around the world on these topics. Our Global Privacy. 
Office, composed of dozens of privacy professionals around the world, is led by Visa’s Chief Privacy Officer and closely coordinates with several cross-functional teams and governance bodies, including our Cybersecurity and. 
Data Governance operations.

We recognize consumers are concerned about how their data is collected, used, shared and kept secure.
Our privacy commitments are outlined in our Privacy. 
Notices and, where we market services directly to consumers, in the terms and conditions of those programs.
In addition to our Global Privacy Policy and the internal standards that form the basis of our Global Privacy Program, we developed a set of Data Values to capture, in plain language, the principles we believe should apply when companies collect consumer data. These values inform. 
Visa’s role as a leader in the payments ecosystem. Data innovation is a vital component of Visa’s strategy — and in everything we do — built on our 60-year legacy of responsible data stewardship.
Security. 
Individuals and businesses should have confidence that. 
Visa payment data is safe. There is no higher priority for Visa than safeguarding those who use our products, services and network.
Control. 
Visa will always strive to provide simple explanations regarding how data may be used and to empower individuals with easy processes to manage use of their data.

These principles, which are aspirational, may evolve over time based on the needs of consumers, businesses and economies and to adapt to new privacy and data-related regulations and standards that may emerge. As Visa’s business moves into new technologies, payment flows and value-added services, we are committed to engaging with policymakers and regulators worldwide to participate in the development and harmonization of privacy regulations and standards.
Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Model Risk Management (MRM) tests models for statistical integrity as well as unintended impacts, like bias.
Visa has developed an extensive, multi-layered governance and accountability structure, including operational, legal, privacy and risk-based frameworks. We have established several internal committees to help ensure our governance and internal values are applied, including the MRM. 
Committee and the Visa Data Use Council.

Transaction Integrity. 
Visa connects the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payments network — enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive. Visa is committed to ensuring the integrity of our payment system. We do not tolerate the use of our network and products for illegal activity, and we are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on our network.
Our approach to protecting the network is grounded in the Visa Rules and our robust compliance programs.
When participants on the network are unable to meet our requirements, we levy financial penalties and, based on the circumstances, suspend or terminate them from our system.
Visa’s Global Brand Protection Program, for example, manages situations where the Visa brand is associated with high-risk or potentially brand-damaging activities, such as internet gambling, pharmaceutical sales and adult content.
As part of the Program, Visa: • Maintains registration requirements for acquirers and merchants, pursuant to which acquirers attest to their compliance with our standards.

Council that reviews and advises on Visa marketing and communications campaigns. The council aims to ensure that representation from historically underrepresented communities is embedded in each campaign, supporting. 
Visa’s belief that economies that include everyone, everywhere, uplift everyone, everywhere. The Advisory. 
Council consists of Visa employees who are members of a Visa ERG and represent varying career levels in non-marketing and non-communications roles. We encourage participation from individuals with varying racial, cultural and gender identities. We believe these diverse perspectives help ensure cultural resonance and relevance to historically underrepresented audiences.

Employee Engagement. 
In 2021, we reorganized and rebranded our Human. 
Resources organization as the “People Team” to better reflect Visa’s strategic people programs and processes. We also created a dedicated Global Employee Engagement function to deepen focus on the employee experience.
As part of our ongoing commitment to increase employee engagement, we focused on planning and executing. 
Return to Office and Reimagining Work, while fostering a culture that values employee growth and wellbeing. Our actions include continuing a bi-weekly video series from our Chairman and CEO, as well as regular all-staff meetings held by our regional and functional leaders to allow employees to ask direct questions about Visa’s business activities and response to global events.
In 2021, we continued to support the evolving needs of employees amid the ongoing environmental, political and public health challenges we faced. Visa’s continued focus on employee experience aligns to four areas: • Employee engagement surveys • Creating a new, inspiring employee value proposition linked to our leadership principles and purpose • Developing a global and comprehensive recognition framework that uplifts everyone, everywhere • Revamping Visa’s year-one new hire experience for enhanced engagement. 
Our @LifeatVisa Instagram channel continues to be an active destination for employees, potential employees and the general public to get a glimpse into Visa’s people, community and culture.
The internal launch of Visa’s brand evolution — Meet. 
Visa — drove record employee engagement with Visa’s new purpose and brand. We focused storytelling across channels to reflect Visa's purpose through perspectives of our employees as they share how their work uplifts everyone, everywhere.
We continue to inform and engage our employees through content on Visa’s intranet, digital signage and employee attendance at events, quarterly all-staff meetings, virtual events, speaker series and other approaches.
Pulse Surveys. 
In 2020, we replaced our Annual Employee Survey with pulse surveys—short-form questionnaires distributed more than once per year to assess employee engagement, satisfaction and wellbeing. Given the challenges of. 
COVID-19 and the sudden transition to remote work arrangements, we tailored these surveys to understand and respond to employee needs in an evolving and complex environment.
According to the results of a 2021 employee pulse survey, employees increasingly feel their different views and opinions are valued and felt free to voice a contrary opinion without fear of any negative consequences. In 2021, we launched a wellbeing-focused pulse survey to inform the design of new and existing global wellbeing offerings for employees.
In 2021, 100% of eligible employees received a performance review.
Performance Reviews. 
In 2021, we implemented a simplified performance review focused on employee impact and development opportunities. This strengthened performance conversations to drive growth and improvement. In 2021, 100 percent of eligible employees received a performance review.
Employee Recognition. 
We continued several new employee recognition programs in 2021, including one that enables our employees and people managers to celebrate their colleagues through our GoBeyond peer-to-peer recognition platform. In 2021, employees sent more than 6,000 virtual cards to their colleagues. A pulse survey from the summer of 2021 noted that 76% of employees feel that Visa is recognizing the people who are doing good work.
In 2022 we plan to create a global blueprint for how we want to standardize and promote a culture of recognition that includes comprehensive practices for event and performance-based amplification across the moments that matter in the employee lifecycle.

Wellbeing Hub, delivering frequent communication from leaders and hosting mental health awareness events.
The Be Well Wellbeing Hub hosts tools, workshops and wellbeing benefits programs organized by region. In addition, at no cost to employees, a dedicated wellness coach is reachable by video, phone or chat.
We enhanced our Wellbeing program in 2021 with the following initiatives: • Launched the Be Well Ambassador program where employees are empowered and equipped to support their colleagues by leading workshops, providing announcements and sharing wellbeing resources.
• Hosted safe spaces sessions for employees facing societal challenges, including Asian American and. 
Pacific Islander, Latinx and Black and African American employees, to decompress and find respite with the support of a facilitator or licensed mental health provider.
• Provided people leader coaching sessions for senior leaders to offer their advice to people leaders and facilitate conversations with experts on topics including digital wellbeing, mental health and work and beyond.
• Offered culturally relevant regional customization for programs outside of North America.
• Tailored Visa talent planning through a cross-functional partnership between the Director of Wellbeing and. 
Visa talent teams to build psychological safety and empathetic leadership into our midyear and annual review processes.
• Scaled our Mental Health and Wellbeing for Peak. 
Performance course in Visa University to be offered in our Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
We are using local and national guidance and emergency and regulatory requirements to implement global best practices as employees return to offices in 2022.
We designed a new Flexible Work approach to be implemented as we welcome our employees back to. 
Visa offices. We work closely with governments and health providers to make vaccines readily available to our employees, along with education sessions on the vaccination process.
We also have enhanced employee COVID-testing offerings, office cleaning protocols and signage and educational materials posted around offices and online platforms.

Employee Safety. 
Visa has a long-standing commitment to protecting the physical safety, mental health and wellbeing of our global workforce. Responsibility and oversight of employee safety resides with the Visa Global Security and Safety (GSS) team, which promotes the safety of Visa’s employees and contingent workers by establishing health and safety practices. In 2021, we expanded the employee headcount in health and safety, emergency preparedness and security operations teams.
The GSS team maintains a global Safety, Health and. 
Environmental policy and provides relevant training to the executive team and key employees. Visa assesses and manages safety risks, provides security measures and oversees emergency response by monitoring: • Emerging security threats, such as natural disasters, civil unrest and terrorist attacks identified through security, government and media sources • Personnel on business travel and employees who are working outside their home countries • Company assets, including facilities and strategic third-party sites. 
Visa’s support for our employees’ safety includes providing employees with the information and resources necessary for them to work effectively and safely. To promote healthy remote work environments, Visa increased flexibility in schedules, encouraged individuals to collaborate with managers to balance professional and personal obligations and launched “Wellbeing Hours” to encourage schedule flexibility at the end of the work week.
Visa also maintains an Ergonomics Program that provides educational information and assistance to help employees create an environment in which they can work comfortably and productively from anywhere.
The Program includes an online office ergonomics training to guide employees on how to identify potential opportunities to improve working habits and adjust workspaces. Upon completion of the training, employees receive a personal plan on how to address identified ergonomic issues.
To track our health and safety performance, Visa conducts both monthly and annual audits of our health and safety equipment and facilities. Each month we track and audit our near misses, injuries and worker compensation claims.

Protecting the Planet


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 35. 
Visa recognizes the importance of protecting our planet and natural resources and of supporting climate action.
We continue to use our products, services, network, expertise, brand and partnerships to minimize the environmental footprint of our operations, inspire and empower sustainable commerce and support the global transition to a low-carbon economy.
Our priorities include: • Sustainable Operations • Sustainable Commerce. 
Our Goals. 
Visa continues to aim to be among global corporate leaders in our efforts in this decisive decade of action.
We focus our efforts on delivering on our corporate climate-focused goals and aspirations:
Carbon neutral operations. 
Maintain carbon neutrality of our operations (greenhouse gas emissions scopes 1 and 2 as well as the business travel and employee commuting components of scope 3).
Net Zero emissions by 2040. 
Eliminate the footprint from our scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions.
Climate positive company. 
Support positive climate action beyond our operational footprint by leveraging our products, services, network and other resources.
Visa’s net zero by 2040 goal is aligned with global standards and definitions and will include efforts with suppliers to abate a significant portion of the greenhouse gas footprint of the Company’s purchased goods and services. Visa also has set science-based targets through the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) at the 1.5 degree Celsius ambition level—targets that were approved by SBTi in May 2022.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 36. 
Sustainable Operations. 
Our initiatives to deliver on our corporate goals for environmental stewardship and climate action begin with our efforts within Visa. We take a proactive approach to reducing the environmental footprint from our business activities, which primarily include data centers and offices, employee commuting, business travel, corporate events and purchased goods and services.
Greening Our Offices & Data Centers. 
Visa is committed to reducing the environmental impact of our offices and data centers by focusing on green building design and operation and managing energy and water use. Our approach includes obtaining the. 
U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and. 
Environmental Design (LEED), BREEAM, Green Mark or equivalent certifications for the design, construction and build-out of our office facilities. We use green building standards and guidelines to increase resource use efficiency within our existing buildings.
As of September 30, 2021, Visa owned or leased 123 office locations in 77 countries around the world, including three data centers. At the end of 2021, approximately 75 percent of Visa’s owned or leased square footage achieved or was pending green building certification.
Visa’s data centers account for more than half of our total electricity consumption and are an important focus of our sustainability efforts. In 2021, we achieved year-over- year improvements in our data center energy efficiency, measured by power usage effectiveness (PUE), as a result of programs such as upgrading our cooling and server equipment. We have also piloted and evaluated innovations like direct expansion, dry mode cooling and immersion cooling to improve our energy and/or water efficiency.
Globally, the PUE in our data centers has improved by 17 percent over the past four years.

2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 37. 
Renewable Electricity. 
Visa continues to meet our goal (first announced in 2018) of purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity for our offices and data centers through participation in utility renewable energy programs and through the purchase of renewable energy certificates.
In 2021, we signed a multi-year agreement with MP2. 
Energy to power Visa’s largest data center – accounting for 45 percent of our electricity usage – with 100 percent renewable electricity from new solar generation facilities. The agreement signals the next phase for Visa advancing its sustainability priorities, including supporting additional renewable electricity capacity to the grid, while positively impacting the environment and local economic development through job creation.
Visa addresses the remainder of our renewable energy requirements through utility partnerships and the purchase of certified renewable energy certificates (RECs) across over 30 different markets.
While we have achieved our goal of purchasing 100 percent renewable electricity, our multi-year approach remains focused on identifying opportunities to expand investments and/or enrollments in renewable electricity offerings, including through long-term renewable electricity purchase agreements, and reduce our purchase of unbundled RECs.
Visa also continues to champion the overall corporate renewable energy movement, including through our membership in the RE100 and support of the Clean Energy. 
Buyers Association.
Travel & Events. 
Though corporate travel and employee commuting remained largely paused throughout 2021, we continued to identify, enable and encourage more sustainable travel and commuting behavior among our employees, including mode switching and staying at green certified hotels.
As part of our efforts to reduce emissions from our air travel, in September 2021, Visa joined the World Economic. 
Forum’s (WEF) Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition as a signatory to advance the commercial scale of viable production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for broad adoption in the industry. Through the Coalition, we are joining with our peer members to contribute to accelerating the supply and use of SAF to reach 10 percent of global jet aviation fuel supply by 2030.
Additionally, in December 2021, Visa joined the United. 
Airlines Eco-Skies Alliance and committed to reducing the carbon emissions from our business travel on the carrier by helping to fund the green premium for SAF.
Visa helps eligible employees reduce the emissions from their commutes, including through providing subsidies for public transit and bicycle commuting and access to electric vehicle chargers in select locations.
Green Bond. 
In 2020, Visa issued our inaugural $500 million green bond — believed to be the first green bond issued by a digital payments network — to finance initiatives that enable sustainable commerce and the transition to low-carbon operations and economy.
We intend for our projects to align with the eligibility categories of the International Capital Market. 
Association’s Green Bond Principles, a voluntary framework that provides guidance and best practices for issuing Green Bonds. Specifically, we are using the green bond, due in 2027, to finance green building projects, energy and water efficiency improvements, expanded use of renewable energy, clean transportation, employee commuter programs, environmentally-friendly technologies and initiatives focused on sustainable consumer behaviors.
In 2021, we published our first Green Bond Report detailing the use of proceeds thus far. Our initial use of the green bond proceeds helped us achieve carbon neutrality and transition to 100 percent renewable electricity across our global operations.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 38. 
Employees. 
Visa strives to inspire our employees around the world to be sustainability champions and advocates in the workplace, at home and in our communities. We do so throughout the year by offering webinars, emails, videos and chat sessions to share tips and suggestions for integrating sustainability into employees’ daily routines.
Each April, we host our global Visa Earth Month series of events, including the Earth Month Speaker Series focused on topics such as the state of the planet, the emergence of the sustainable consumer and the role that fintech can play in sustainability and our Earth Month Eco-Challenge, which asks employees to make simple commitments to help reduce their footprint and to support Visa’s commitments to sustainability.
In 2021, we created a new sustainability learning path within. 
Visa University, our training and development platform.
The new learning path is designed to give employees a foundation in topics and solutions related to sustainability and climate change.
Suppliers. 
Visa recognizes the importance of addressing the emissions from our purchased goods and services, which make up 94 percent of Visa’s scope 3 emissions. To that end, Visa engages with our suppliers to help them measure and report their emissions and to set Science Based Targets.
Our efforts to engage suppliers include incorporating environmental sustainability expectations in the Visa. 
Supplier Code of Conduct, which suppliers receive during the onboarding process, and Visa’s participation in the. 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain program.
Through the CDP Supply Chain program, we engage our leading suppliers around measuring their emissions footprint, setting targets, reporting to the CDP and attributing their footprint back to Visa.
Since joining the CDP Supply Chain program, Visa has expanded outreach to suppliers who represent approximately two-thirds of Visa’s emissions as calculated by spend.
Our Results. 
To measure and manage our environmental impact,
Visa has conducted a global environmental footprint assessment with support from leading third-party firms each year since 2008. We measure our global energy and water use, waste production, landfill diversion and. 
GHG emissions. Our energy and GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party. The 2021 GHG. 
Verification Statement is publicly available on our website and included in the Appendix of this report.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 39. 
Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions. 
Around the world, momentum continues to accelerate behind the need to take urgent action on climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy. Visa is responding by taking serious action to reduce. 
GHG emissions, including achieving carbon neutrality across our operations for the first time in 2020.
This achievement, which includes the footprint from our scope 1, scope 2 and the employee commuting/business travel components of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, is the result of ongoing energy efficiency initiatives, our transition to 100 percent renewable electricity and limited use of carbon offsets to cover our residual footprint. Our carbon offsets portfolio spans regions in which we operate and includes projects such as forest management in the U.S., reforestation in Uruguay, renewable energy generation in Turkey, China and India and clean cookstove initiatives in Kenya and Uganda.
We use international standards, including the GHG Protocol, to measure and report GHG emissions associated primarily with our energy usage, business travel and employee commuting.
In 2021, we used approximately 646,000 gigajoules (GJ) of energy from electricity, natural gas and other fuels – an eight percent decrease in consumption compared to 2020.
Our energy intensity per square foot, a commonly used metric that adjusts for growth, improved by 10 percent year-over-year, the seventh consecutive year of improvement.
Our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, measured in absolute terms with a market-based approach, were 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) in 2021. This represents a 71 percent decrease year-over-year from 2020—largely driven by the achievement of our goal to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity.
In 2021, Visa responded to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire for the 11th consecutive year and was named to the CDP A-List for the first time. Visa’s CDP response is available on the websites of.

Water. 
We recognize the importance of protecting water as a shared resource, particularly in water- constrained areas. Although as a payments technology company Visa’s business is not water intensive, we do implement data-driven strategies to reduce the total water use at our offices and data centers.
In 2021, we used an estimated 38,950,000 gallons of potable water in our global portfolio.
We largely attribute our 32 percent potable water usage decrease year-over-year to temporary office closures. By facility type, 77 percent of potable water use occurred in our offices, while 23 percent occurred in our data centers, in which we use a significant amount of reclaimed water.
In 2021, 46% of Visa’s total water usage came from reclaimed water.
Waste. 
While not a major producer of solid waste, Visa continues to reduce the amount of office waste we dispose of in landfills each year. Visa works to reduce waste streams at our office facilities and data centers through thoughtful design of our spaces and kitchenettes, engaging with our food service providers, reducing single-use items and plastics and by engaging employees through education and awareness building.
In 2021, we achieved a landfill diversion rate of 43 percent, or 22.9 kg per employee.
Diversion rate per employee is calculated based on the total amount of Visa’s operational waste that is recycled, reused or composted in the reporting year divided by the total number of employees. This does not include waste that is landfilled or incinerated.

Sustainable Commerce. 
Visa continues to expand our initiatives toward being a climate positive company by embedding sustainability across our business. Our existing efforts to support a low- carbon future across our network include: • Research & Insights: Supporting and/or conducting research to understand barriers to and drivers of sustainable living behaviors • Cards & Accounts: Embedding sustainability features in payment cards and accounts • Sustainable Behaviors: Global initiatives supporting sustainable behaviors, such as in mobility and travel • Global Movement: Using our platforms, partnerships and sponsorships to inspire and empower sustainable living among millions of consumers. 
Research & Insights. 
Visa’s approach to enabling sustainable commerce begins with our efforts to help the broader payments and commerce ecosystem understand the barriers to and drivers of sustainable living behaviors—particularly among consumers—and the opportunities for digital payments to support a low-carbon economy.
• Empower citizens: Through product and service innovation, as well as the provision of information and choice architecture • Provision of data-driven insights: Payments data- driven products and services • Collaboration and partnerships: Shaping and creating new services and solutions with others • Narrative and advocacy: Using corporate influence to shape the broader landscape for the net zero transition. 
Highlights of our efforts in 2021 include the following:
For the third year, Visa participated as a design partner in GlobeScan’s Healthy and Sustainable Living Study, which focused on attitudes, opinions and behaviors linked to healthier and more sustainable lifestyles and reached 30,000+ consumers spanning 31 markets.
Visa partnered with third-party research firms to conduct bespoke research on consumer attitudes toward sustainability features in payments accounts, starting in four markets. We continue to disseminate the results of this work to our clients and partners.
Visa collaborated with the Cambridge Institute for. 
Sustainability Leadership (CISL) to identify new opportunities for electronic payments and networks to support a sustainable future. As a result of this work, CISL identified four roles that payment networks can play to bridge the “opportunity gap” by enabling net zero solutions.
Read the CISL report, Payments for Net Zero: How the payments industry can contribute to the transition to a net zero economy, to learn more.
Cards & Accounts. 
As a global payments network, we believe we can play an important role in helping consumers and businesses shift to more sustainable behaviors through our efforts to embed sustainability into physical payment cards and help enable sustainable features in payment accounts.
Highlights of our 2021 progress include: • Expanded partnership with ecolytiq offering bank and financial institutions an all-in-one Sustainable-as-a-
Service® solution to empower their customers to take climate action.
• Announced the launch of Visa Eco Benefits to allow account issuers to add sustainability-focused benefits to existing Visa cardholder credit/debit products toward the goal of enabling their cardholders to engage in sustainable consumption.
• Continued to support the introduction and uptake by our clients of sustainable materials for physical payment cards, including the CPI Card Group’s payment card composed of up to 98 percent upcycled plastic.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 42. 
Sustainable Behaviors. 
In addition to our efforts to support sustainable commerce through incorporating sustainability features in payment cards and accounts, Visa also continues to work in areas where we believe our products, services, network, expertise and/or brand platform can play a role.
Highlights from 2021 include:
Urban Mobility. 
Visa is working to bring digital payments to citizens’ door-to-door journeys, to reduce emissions and address climate change. In 2021, Visa continued to work with transit agencies in more than 400 cities worldwide to support sustainable mobility through contactless ticketing and fare payment solutions.
In 2021, Visa continued our partnership with the Global. 
Resilient Cities Network (GRCN) to help cities become more resilient to the physical, environmental, social and economic challenges of the 21st century.
Electric Vehicle Charging (EVC)
Visa is supporting the global transition to electric vehicles, by partnering with leading participants in the EVC ecosystem through enhancing the customer payment experience at charging stations. In 2021, Visa continued to expand usage of a dedicated merchant category code for EVC, jointly published a white paper on open loop payments for EVC, conducted a study on EVC challenges and opportunities and served as lead supporter of the. 
EV Summit. As we entered 2022, Visa also announced our joining as the first payments community member of. 
CharIN, an international charging initiative working with all parts of the e-mobility value chain.
Travel & Tourism. 
Visa continued our efforts to help advance sustainable travel and tourism through our founding partner role with Travalyst, a sustainable travel and tourism initiative founded by the Duke of Sussex together with Skyscanner,
Booking.com, Trip.com Group and TripAdvisor.
Visa also launched the Visa for Athens sustainable tourism initiative, contributed to the Net Zero Roadmap of the. 
World Travel & Tourism Council and served as a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council for. 
Sustainable Tourism.
Global Movement. 
Visa remains committed to helping build and support the overall sustainable living movement. Highlights of our progress in 2021 include:
Industry Initiatives. 
In 2021, Visa joined the World Business Council for. 
Sustainable Development, a global, CEO-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. Visa also continued to serve as a Founding Partner of and contributor to Brands for Good, an initiative of Sustainable Brands focused on building a movement among leading brands to make sustainable living more attractive, rewarding and attainable. Visa’s Chief Sustainability Officer became a founding member of the Adweek Sustainability Council, a group comprised of CMOs and heads of sustainability from the world’s top brands working to address responsible environmental practices, social purpose and equality, as well as the NYSE Sustainability Advisory Council.
Public Policy. 
At Visa, we believe in the importance of supporting public policy dialogue as part of our approach to sustainable commerce, decarbonization and net zero. In 2021, we continued our participation in the Energy and Environment. 
Coordinating Committee of the Business Roundtable (BRT), the Sustainable Finance Working Group of the. 
Institute for International Finance (IIF) and various sustainability-focused working groups of the Information. 
Technology Industry Council (ITI).


Alignment with Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Governance. 
Throughout 2021, Visa focused on increasing Board engagement and education on climate-related issues through quarterly ESG updates to the Nominating and. 
Corporate Governance Committee, which meets at least quarterly and has formal responsibility for and oversight of corporate responsibility and sustainability policies, programs and reporting, including those related to climate change.
These updates cover internal climate-related goals, initiatives and external developments, including on climate-related goals, initiatives and risk. Our Chief. 
Sustainability Officer communicates directly with the. 
Board and continues to help formalize oversight and governance of climate-related topics within Visa.
Strategy. 
Visa’s global sustainability strategy centers on our goals of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and maintaining carbon neutral operations, while limiting use of offsets.
We harness our global brand and initiatives to drive decarbonization efforts and promote sustainable practices beyond our direct operations. An example of these actions was the launch of Visa Eco Benefits, a new package of sustainability-focused benefits for account issuers designed to enable and encourage cardholders to engage in sustainable consumption behaviors. This new account benefits bundle expands Visa’s sustainability solutions for clients as part of our climate positive goal.
We continue to monitor and assess climate-related risks and opportunities and embed these considerations into our business strategy decisions. See our inaugural. 
Green Bond report for information on the financing of our climate-related objectives.
Risk Management. 
Visa maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
Framework to identify, assess, treat, monitor and report on substantive risks. Prior to FY21, we conducted a deep dive into our climate-related risks and opportunities in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial. 
Disclosures (TCFD). This exercise analyzed both direct and indirect climate-related risks and opportunities across our entire business for Business as Usual and 2-Degree climate scenarios. We aim to update the TCFD assessment on a periodic basis and leverage the findings into our existing. 
ERM process to inform our business planning.
As an outcome of this analysis, Visa has taken notable steps to reduce upstream risks in our supply chain.
Beginning in 2018 we began collaborating with CDP to collect supplier-specific data. Additionally, through our supplier engagement program, we anticipate that we will continue to utilize the CDP Supply Chain survey to collect direct data from our suppliers, enhance ESG language in our Supplier Code of Conduct, develop supplier scorecards, create educational materials on climate topics for internal and external stakeholders and develop individualized engagement approaches on climate topics for our top suppliers.
Metrics & Targets. 
In 2021, we formally submitted near-term GHG reduction targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The targets — covering scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions and in line with a 1.5°C pathway — were approved by SBTi in May 2022.
In addition, Visa has set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Climate. 
Agreement goal. This goal covers both direct operations and our supply chain.
We have further developed our approach to 100% renewable electricity to focus on renewable electricity procurement options at our largest facilities and data centers, such as utility and renewable programs, and to rely less on unbundled renewable energy certificates.
This demonstrates that Visa is evolving our approach to renewable electricity procurement to help ensure that our purchases support renewable electricity generation in the areas where we operate.
The largest area of impact in our value chain lies with our suppliers. We are expanding on associated metrics, including improved measurement and management of emissions and emissions targets globally.
As part of our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, in 2021 Visa became a new signatory of The Climate Pledge, an initiative co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism, as well as a new member of the Climate Business Network, a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) initiative to accelerate action toward a net-zero future.

Corporate Governance. 
Visa’s corporate governance practices help promote long-term value and strong Board and management accountability to our diverse set of stakeholders. Our. 
Board of Directors oversees and monitors important governance issues, including risk management, board composition and refreshment, executive and Board compensation and ESG matters.
We regularly monitor our corporate governance policies and practices to confirm we meet or exceed the requirements of applicable laws and the New York Stock. 
Exchange's listing standards and that we are responsive to investors. Visa’s corporate governance framework, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, exemplifies our commitment to these standards.
Board Structure. 
As of May 2022, Visa’s Board of Directors is an 11-member board with 10 independent members. Al Kelly serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board, and. 
John Lundgren serves as our Lead Independent Director, responsible for providing independent leadership to the Board. Our directors exhibit an effective mix of skills, qualifications, perspectives and experience in payments, technology, finance and ESG.
Visa’s Corporate Governance Guidelines establish various limits on our directors serving on publicly traded company boards and audit committees. We limit our directors to serving on four publicly-traded company boards (including Visa), or two for executive officers of publicly- traded companies (including Visa). The Board may grant exceptions to established limits on a case-by-case basis.
To best serve our shareholders, employees and customers, the Board periodically reviews and evaluates its internal leadership structure and Lead. 
Independent Director responsibilities.
Our current Board committees include Audit and Risk,
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Corporate. 
Governance. All four Board committees are composed solely of independent directors. Each committee operates pursuant to a written charter, available on the Investor. 
Relations page of our website.
Board Diversity. 
Visa strives to reflect the diversity of our global key constituencies, including clients, customers, employees, business partners and stockholders, in the makeup of our Board. To support this objective, the Nominating and. 
Corporate Governance Committee considers women and candidates from underrepresented groups in the pool from which the Committee considers director candidates. As of April 2022, Visa’s overall board diversity (gender, race, ethnicity) is at 64%, with gender diversity specifically at 36%.

Board & Executive Compensation Programs & Philosophy. 
Visa’s approach to executive compensation includes a recognition that ESG practices are important elements of long-term corporate strategy and contribute to Visa being a sustainable and responsible company. Annual goals incorporate and promote ESG factors that are relevant to the Company’s strategic objectives, such as: inclusion and diversity; employee leadership and development; employee health, safety, productivity and engagement; cybersecurity and data privacy; sustainability and climate; financial inclusion and access; and corporate governance.
For more on our approach to executive compensation, please refer to page 7 of the report and our 2022 Proxy Statement.
Ethics & Compliance. 
We work to maintain the trust of our stakeholders through our culture of honesty and integrity, in which we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards, and by continuously strengthening our ethics and compliance program.
Visa’s global compliance program provides processes and controls to manage legal and regulatory risk, drive an ethical culture and empower the business to achieve. 
Visa’s objectives legally and with integrity. The Office of the. 
Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, along with the business leadership, is responsible for Visa’s global compliance and ethics program.
Our commitment to ethics and compliance is captured in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code), which applies to everyone working with or on behalf of Visa, including employees, contingent staff and the Board of. 
Directors. We provide a Code of Business Conduct and. 
Ethics training to improve employee knowledge and retention of content, achieving a 100% completion rate for all eligible Visa employees.
The Code includes a supplemental Code of Ethics for. 
Certain Executives and Financial Officers, which requires senior officers to engage in honest and ethical conduct in performing their duties and provides guidelines for the ethical handling of conflicts of interest and reporting of unethical conduct. Additionally, Visa’s Supplier Code of Conduct further explains our expectations and values to suppliers.
We maintain a confidential compliance hotline, operated by a third party, to allow anyone to share questions, concerns or comments online or by phone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, our “Speak Up” Campaign aims to empower employees to report misconduct. Our updated Global Ethical Manager Toolkit helps leaders engage in team discussions related to ethics.
We continue to strengthen our approach to embed ethics and compliance into enterprise-wide management processes and business leader performance scorecards.
In 2021, Visa reinforced its commitment to ethical operations while transitioning to a primarily virtual business environment.
Visa measures and monitors ethical behavior through the use of Regional Scorecard metrics that have direct impact on performance rating decisions and associated bonus of first line business leaders. Every quarter, our Compliance leaders review status of progress against agreed upon goals with the regional president and country managers, and report at year end on achievement of those goals to the Visa Chairman and CEO and President. These metrics, together with similar metrics from Controllership, Risk, and Audit, directly impact the compensation of business leaders in the organization.
In early 2022, Visa was named to the World’s Most Ethical. 
Companies list by Ethisphere. 
Institute for the tenth consecutive year.

Engaging with Governments. 
Visa actively engages with governments, officials, policymakers and stakeholders across the world to help shape the future of digital payments. Through our partnerships, we foster innovation and find opportunities to drive digital transformation and further enable access to financial services.
Visa is committed to transparency around our political involvement. We publish an annual Visa Inc. Corporate. 
Political Contributions Report, which includes a listing of all U.S. trade associations to which Visa pays annual membership dues that are $25,000 or more, and, if applicable, the portion of dues that were used for political expenditures. In the United States, we disclose all contributions made by Visa’s Political Action Committee (PAC) in accordance with the requirements of the Federal. 
Election Commission. In 2021, we made updates to our. 
PAC Giving Criteria for proposed contributions, which was approved by the Board.
Visa once again earned "Trendsetter" status on the 2021. 
CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate. 
Political Disclosure and. 
Accountability with a perfect score of 100.
Visa contributes its expertise in digital payments to help government partners advance their development goals, such as supporting the government of Japan in increasing the percentage of payments made digitally to 40 percent by 2025.
Through Visa University, we also provide training and outreach programs to governments and policymakers around the world to allow us to foster the exchange of ideas on legal and economic aspects of digital financial services.
Visa also engages in strategic partnerships with a wide range of international and multilateral organizations, universities, think tanks and other policy organizations to share perspectives and contribute to policy dialogue on the future of payments, small business enablement, sustainability and digital equity and inclusion, among other issues.
In 2021, Visa participated in a range of collaborative efforts, including: • Contributing to the World Economic Forum’s Data for. 
Common Purpose Initiative, including the development and publication of novel frameworks for responsible data marketplaces.

Tax Compliance & Governance. 
Relationships are at the heart of Visa’s business. We know that trust must be continuously earned and are committed to being a transparent and reliable partner in business and in engagement with governments and the communities we serve. Visa operates globally and seeks to comply with applicable laws, regulations and requirements, including those related to tax, around the world.
A global team of tax professionals, in close coordination with business units, manages tax affairs in every Visa region. Everyone working for, or on behalf of, Visa shares a responsibility to follow our Code of Business Conduct and. 
Ethics and work with integrity. Visa has a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion or the facilitation of tax evasion.
Tax oversight resides with management, including relevant oversight committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors.
In addition to following the letter of the law, we strive to adhere to the spirit of tax laws. Visa insists on adherence to our values, honoring our commitments, and avoiding activities that could adversely affect our reputation. We make tax planning decisions in a manner that is consistent with Visa’s commercial business and economic activities, evaluating the tax implications and risks related to potential transactions.
Visa’s statement on tax compliance and governance is available online at visa.com/esg under Operating Responsibly.
Responsible Sourcing. 
Beyond Visa operations, our commitment to operate responsibly and sustainably extends to our suppliers and business partners. In 2021, we continued implementation of the Supplier Code of Conduct (Supplier Code) and focused on maintaining our supplier relationships throughout the pandemic.
Our global Supplier Code outlines our expectations in areas including human rights, employment practices, environmental impact, supplier diversity, conflicts of interest and other aspects of responsible business. We reference the Supplier Code in our global Governing. 
Agreements with suppliers and in our Global Sourcing. 
Policy. We also send the Supplier Code to new suppliers during their onboarding process.
When identifying new suppliers to work with Visa, we aim to partner with suppliers that share the same respect for human rights, including those principles recognized in international human rights standards such as the Universal. 
Declaration of Human Rights. Suppliers’ approaches to human rights should be consistent with the UN Guiding. 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. Suppliers are expected to comply with all applicable legal requirements related to human rights.
In 2021, Visa took additional steps to engage prospective and existing suppliers to understand their current integration of various ESG topics and plans to improve.
To complement these efforts, we are partnering with. 
EcoVadis, a leading supply chain-focused ESG ratings organization, to collect data and measure the ESG impact in our supply chain.
Visa has expanded its engagement with our top suppliers around climate change and other environmental issues.
We include environmental criteria for consideration in requests for proposal as part of weighted scoring for suppliers in addition to diversity and social responsibility.
Supplier Diversity. 
Expanding engagement with diverse suppliers is a priority business imperative that adds value to our brand, provides a competitive advantage and reflects our customer base.
We strive to include inclusion and diversity provisions in new sourcing agreements in North America operations and commit to working with qualified suppliers who fully meet the criteria established in our Supplier Diversity Program.
Visa partners with a third-party supplier to provide up to date information on supplier diversity certifications for our suppliers, allowing us to report more accurately with independently validated data.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 49. 
As part of Visa’s Stand Together Initiative, we have made significant investments in and commitments to fostering a diverse supplier base. Our progress on the following goals is reported internally to the Visa Executive Committee on a quarterly basis, identifying progress and opportunities for continuous improvement.
• Requesting diverse account teams for preferred suppliers and partners.
• Increasing the number of diverse suppliers in our network, and thereby increasing Visa spend with these suppliers.
• Requiring diverse sourcing options for spend across RFPs.
We encourage our prime non-diverse suppliers to establish relationships with, and commit a percentage of expenditures to, diverse suppliers. Prime suppliers participating in our Second-Tier Initiative report information and data on their specific use of small and diverse suppliers. We have implemented a system to track. 
Visa spend with diverse Tier II suppliers.
Visa also invests in tools and memberships with diverse supplier certification organizations like the National. 
Minority Supplier Development Council, Women’s. 
Business Enterprise National Council, National LGBT. 
Chamber of Commerce and Western Regional Minority. 
Supplier Development Council.
In 2021, Visa expanded Supplier Diversity programs to additional regions beyond North America, designing and developing reporting criteria and qualifications based on data availability. The expansion focused on small and micro businesses owned by historically underrepresented individuals. For example, an area of focus in South Africa was on women and the Broad Based Black Economic. 
Empowerment program.
Human Rights. 
We recognize our responsibility to respect and, where possible, promote human rights across our company, operations and supply chain, including standards identified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the. 
International Labour Organization Declaration on the. 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our approach to respecting human rights is informed by the United. 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Guiding Principles).
Visa's cross-functional Human Rights Working Group (HRWG) oversees our overall approach, including risk identification, mitigation and due diligence strategy.
The HRWG shares progress with members of the Visa executive team and Board of Directors on a regular basis.
The Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance. 
Committee provides human rights oversight as part of its overarching ESG responsibility, as detailed in the. 
Committee’s Charter.
We completed our most recent triennial Human. 
Rights Impact Assessment in 2020. Through this global assessment—conducted in accordance with the Guiding. 
Principles—we identify and review salient human rights risks resulting from our operations, network, supply chain, partnerships and sponsorships.


2021 Environmental, Social & Governance Report | 50. 
Informed by this assessment, our human rights strategy focuses on mitigating risks emanating from Visa’s role as a/an:
Employer. 
We acknowledge and respect the human rights of each employee.

Policies contributing to the respect of human rights of our employees include:
Harassment and Discrimination Policy; Safety, Health and. 
Environmental Policy; Whistleblower Policy and Non-
Retaliation Policy.
Purchaser. 
We acknowledge and respect the human rights of workers in our supply chain. Our Supplier Code outlines our expectations for suppliers including safe working conditions and respect of human rights.

Business Partner and Sponsor. 
We incorporate respect for human rights into the expectations of and engagement with our partnerships and sponsorships, including issues at the intersection of sport and human rights.
In 2021, Visa advanced our human rights due diligence approach through: • Conducting a review of the human rights implications of artificial intelligence (AI) and Visa’s current approach to responsible AI.

Centre’s Advisory Board and Mega-Sporting Events. 
Working Group.

As a sponsor of major sports bodies and events, Visa remains a proud founding supporter and Advisory. 
Council member of the Centre for Sport and Human. 
Rights (CSHR).

GHG Verification Methodology:
Evidence-gathering procedures included but were not limited to: � Interviews with relevant personnel of VISA; � Review of documentary evidence produced by VISA; � Review of VISA data and information systems and methodology for collection, aggregation, analysis and review of information used to determine GHG emissions; and � Audit of sample of data used by VISA to determine GHG emissions.
Verification Opinion:
Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the GHG emissions statement shown above: � is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of the GHG emissions data and information; and � has not been prepared in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2), and WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 3).
It is our opinion that VISA has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data for determination of these GHG emissions for the stated period and boundaries.
