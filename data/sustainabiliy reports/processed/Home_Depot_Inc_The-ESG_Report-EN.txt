Overview Strengthen Our Communities Focus on Our People Our Business Operate Sustainably Reporting Framework Table of Contents International Retail Operations. 
We organize our approach to corporate responsibility around three key pillars: Focusing on Our People, Operating Sustainably and Strengthening Our Communities.
CEO LETTER OUR SUCCESS STARTS WITH OUR CULTURE. 
Continues on next page. 
When I joined The Home Depot more than 22 years ago, I could never have imagined that I would have the opportunity to lead such an incredible organization. Prior to becoming CEO, I had the privilege to work in multiple departments across the organization. One thing that has always been clear to me is that our values-driven culture and passion for our customers has been instrumental to our success. Built around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars – Focus on Our People, Operate Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our 2022 ESG Report details the daily work we do to support these three pillars, as well as the progress we made in 2021 thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of our associates and suppliers. Our focus on people centers around continuously striving to create a work environment that is inclusive, engaging, and rewarding to associates. Our associates’ outstanding performance in 2021 enabled 100% of our stores to qualify for Success Sharing bonus payments to non-management associates. We also offer training and development that transforms jobs into careers, which is reflected in the fact that approximately 90% of our U.S. store leaders began as hourly associates. Our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the U.S. working population. In addition, we increased the representation of female and underrepresented minority groups across our managers and above cohort in the U.S. during 2021.
CEO Letter “Built around our core values, our approach to ESG centers around three key pillars – Focus on Our People, Operate. 
Sustainably, and Strengthen Our Communities. By identifying these three pillars, we can concentrate on the areas where we can have the greatest impact.” – Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot. 
We believe our associates should reflect the customers and communities we serve. In 2021, approximately 36% of our U.S. new hires were women, while more than 57% of U.S. new hires were from an underrepresented minority group. Our commitment to diversity also extends to our supplier relationships. In 2021, we increased our spend with diverse suppliers to $3.3 billion and have announced a goal to achieve $5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025. We also completed our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program to encourage our suppliers to spend with diverse businesses. We will continue to push forward in this area by partnering with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable, an association geared at celebrating corporations that spend at least $1 billion per year with minority- and woman-owned suppliers, to further amplify our supplier diversity efforts.
Our efforts to operate sustainably begin with our understanding that our biggest impact on the environment comes from the products we sell. Our partnership with suppliers allows us to give our customers access to hundreds of products that are good for their homes, good for the environment, and good for their wallets. In 2021, we estimate our customers’ purchases of Energy Star products helped reduce annual electricity use by 7 billion kilowatt hours, saving $950 million on energy costs, and lowering carbon emissions by 4.9 million metric tons. Our water-saving products allowed customers to reduce consumption by over 66 billion gallons.

CEO Letter “We know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient.” – Ted Decker, CEO and president of The Home Depot. 
We also made progress in 2021 by operating more sustainably in our own business, reducing electricity consumption in our U.S. stores by approximately 11% year-over-year. We cut U.S. store electricity usage a remarkable 50% since 2010. A hallmark of progress in this area has been the transition to LED overhead lighting in our U.S. stores, which join our Canada and Mexico stores in having nearly all of interior lighting powered by LED bulbs. While we remain focused on reducing our energy consumption, we are also making progress towards our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030. We focus on strengthening our communities by giving back financially and through our associates’ time and efforts dedicated to Team Depot volunteer activities – a hallmark of who we are. In 2021, approximately 14,000 associates volunteered in communities across 150 cities nationwide. Our Team Depot volunteers helped our communities prepare and respond to natural disasters like tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires, while also achieving more than 1.25 million hours of service to veterans since 2011.
We also value our nonprofit partners that enable The Home Depot Foundation to improve the homes and lives of U.S. veterans, train skilled tradespeople to fill the labor gap, and support communities affected by natural disasters. In 2021, the Foundation achieved a milestone of ten years and over $400 million invested in support of veteran causes, on track to contribute half of a billion dollars to veteran causes by 2025. While we have made significant progress, there is more work to do. On Pages 9 and 10 of this report, you will see the goals we’ve set as we strive to build a better and more sustainable business.
We know that when we invest in running a responsible, sustainable company, we make our business stronger, more agile, and more resilient. 2021 was another year filled with great accomplishments, and I want to thank our associates and supplier partners for the many ways they enable us to do our part and live our values every day.

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS & SETTING PRIORITIES. 
As the largest home improvement retailer in the world, we have the unique opportunity to create positive impacts across a broad number of stakeholders. We have also been reminded over the last two years how quickly our world can change, which is why we continue our practice of proactive engagement and provide numerous channels for feedback, so we can remain attentive to the concerns and needs of our stakeholders. We have learned over the years that one of the best ways for us to make sure we understand the relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts of our business and the current areas of focus of our many stakeholders is to engage with our stakeholders. This engagement comes through multiple channels. We receive constant feedback from our customers through the more than a billion and a half transactions across our stores and digital channels annually.
We survey our approximately 500,000 associates to measure how emotionally connected they are to their work. We collaborate with our vendors and suppliers in an effort to lessen the environmental impact of the products we sell. Individuals and organizations from around the globe reach out to us with questions or concerns about our operations or products. We meet with shareholders and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) interested in our business practices. We take part in industry efforts to raise awareness about the ESG responsibilities we all share. Our ongoing interactions may be formal or informal, as detailed in our ESG Priority Assessment Framework on Page 7. These interactions help validate our own priority assessment; they also help us gauge the impact of our business, refine ESG priorities, measure our progress and design ways to improve.

We value seeing ESG impact and opportunities through our operational lens and also through the lenses of our stakeholders.
By better understanding our impact and collaborating with stakeholders, we position our company to set objectives that allow us to contribute to building a better business, workplace and world. Our Sustainability Council, composed of representatives from different areas of the business, oversees our approach to sustainability. Members of the Council share stakeholder feedback from their functional areas. The Council focuses on several key areas, as shown below. The Council meets twice a year, and its chair presents our sustainability strategy and activities to the Board of Directors annually. We also provide quarterly updates to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding our ESG engagement. Our ESG priorities and plans are communicated internally and externally via various channels, including in this annual report.

Home Depot’s chief sustainability officer Ron Jarvis has spent more than two decades driving sustainability improvements at The Home Depot. Here he offers insights into our progress.
FAQ: WE ALL OWN SUSTAINABILITY. 
Who drives ESG at The Home Depot?
How is The Home Depot helping customers increase the sustainability of their homes and businesses? Is sustainability a competitive advantage for The Home Depot?
How have associates helped drive ESG progress at The Home Depot?
Many associates and business leaders throughout our enterprise! They take pride in improving their departments and businesses in multiple ESG aspects. Our leadership understands that an effective environmental, social and governance strategy cannot happen in isolation. It is not the sole responsibility of a corporate ESG team. Rather, our ESG strategy must reflect The Home Depot’s core values, and it must be embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Everybody owns it.
Our Eco Actions program, which builds on our original Eco Options program that we launched in 2007, helps our customers take on more sustainable DIY projects and choose greener products that can save water, conserve energy or are formulated to reduce certain chemicals. Products can only qualify for this distinction if manufacturers provide third-party verification of environmental claims that meet our program’s requirements. This program also offers customers green project ideas and tips, for example, how to grow an organic garden (see Page 50). In addition, we encourage our customers to drop off used compact fluorescent light bulbs and rechargeable batteries for recycling. In 2021, we collected 1,162,800 pounds of recycled batteries, a 24% increase since 2014 (see Page 54). We also help our customers go greener in ways that may be less apparent to them. For example, we offer circularity-centered products like our Home Depot-branded moving boxes, made from 100% postconsumer recycled paper fiber (see Page 45), as well as composite deck boards made from recycled plastic waste from our stores. We continue to make progress on our goal to exclude expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film from our private-brand product packaging by the end of 2023. When customers rent tools from us, they help avoid the environmental impact of new product manufacturing. Another example: Our stores have cut electricity consumption 50% since 2010, providing our customers a lower energy intensive shopping environment.
Overall, we believe good business decisions drive sustainability. Examples of this can be seen through the investments we’ve made to create the most efficient supply chain in home improvement. These investments have helped us reduce the number of trucks needed and distance traveled to get our products from our supplier to our customers, while also reducing fuel emissions. Another example of this is our store investments, part of which included transitioning stores to LED lighting, which helped us reduce operating costs and electricity consumption.
We also believe that by working with our suppliers to bring innovative and sustainable products to market, we help our customers create more sustainable homes and workplaces. Our efforts to drive innovation can be seen in every aisle of the store, and we believe this is a key differentiator in the market.
We also want to see sustainability be the norm for our entire industry. We are encouraged when we see other retailers take big swings and do innovative things that push all of us to do a better job of protecting the planet, and we hope the innovation that we bring through our operations and products motivates others to do the same.
One of our eight core values is Do The Right Thing, which drives our associates to find new ways that our organization can reduce its environmental impact. This can be seen through our packaging team who looks for ways to reduce the package footprints and ways to use more sustainable materials for our private-label products (see Page 55). Another example are our associates who work to find ways to upcycle the packaging waste in our stores and supply chain into new products like Trex composite decking.

Our Business Reporting Framework Table of Contents International Retail Operations Operate Sustainably. 
While our office of Diversity & Inclusion has existed within the company for more than a decade to help diversify our workforce and support change in our communities, we expanded in 2020 and renamed it to fit an enhanced mission: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). Adding equity to our focus reflects our desire to promote fairness, remove bias and ensure all of our associates and business partners have access to the resources they need to succeed at work. In 2021, we met our goal to expand our associate resource groups (ARGs) beyond our Store Support Center (corporate facility) to include more associates and increase engagement and participation. Through our new associate engagement platform, Yammer, all our U.S. associates are now able to access our ARGs. We also leveraged Yammer to reach more associates with C.A.R.E. talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates. Learn more here: Page 26. We were also able to meet our goal to launch a Tier II supplier diversity program in 2021. Beyond the $3.3 billion we spent with diverse Tier I (direct) suppliers last year, our new program will help us measure and encourage our Tier I suppliers to spend more with diverse businesses. Find out more about our supplier diversity efforts on Page 60. At The Home Depot, we define diversity, equity and inclusion as: Diversity: Composition of people, such as their similarities and differences (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation) Equity: Norms, practices and policies in place that ensure just and fair opportunities and outcomes, allowing individuals to reach their full potential. 
Inclusion: How we embrace and enable our associates to feel safe, respected, engaged, motivated and valued for who they are and their contributions KEY AREAS OF FOCUS At The Home Depot, we focus on three key areas to create meaningful change through thoughtful actions that align with all eight of our core values. ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT. 
DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION. 
We strive to create an environment centered around our eight core values, where diversity, equity and inclusion fuel opportunities for our associates, communities, and suppliers.
CHECK IT OUT When Khareem Mitchell started with The Home Depot in 2018, he discovered a workplace where his personal principles aligned with company values. His AfroHispanic roots play a big role in how he conducts his life — both inside and outside of work.
• Increasing diverse representation throughout our organization • Creating an environment where every associate feels included and valued for who they are • Promoting equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development and advancement. 
We have many initiatives currently in the works, including an expansion of our existing Retool Your School program to further strengthen our commitment to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). This expansion, set to launch in 2023, will include more programming and a broader reach (See Page 62). In addition, we are working to enlarge our network of external partner organizations to enhance the career development of our female, minority, LGBTQ+ and veteran associates.
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. 
SUPPLIER DIVERSITY • Striving to close the wealth gap • Advancing education for all • Increasing our penetration and spend with diverse suppliers • Developing diverse suppliers by providing mentorship and shared resources.

Derek Bottoms, chief diversity officer and vice president of associate relations, explains how diversity, equity and inclusion align with our company values. DOING THE RIGHT THING. 
SPOTLIGHT. 
What does diversity, equity and inclusion mean at The Home Depot? At The Home Depot, our values guide us on everything we do. They serve as our foundation, and they are embedded in our culture. Our expanded focus on diversity, equity and inclusion supports all eight of our core values, including respect for all people, giving back and building strong relationships with other associates and our customers. We strive to build a workplace and retail space that reflect the communities we serve. A diverse and inclusive workplace also creates shareholder value by providing different perspectives and fresh ideas that spark innovation.
What are some ways The Home Depot is driving progress for its stakeholders?
We recently expanded our associate resource groups (ARGs) to all associates companywide, including in stores and distribution centers. Previously, these groups were only available to our Store Support Center (SSC) associates. (Go to Page 26 to learn more.) In an aligned effort, we are identifying tools and platforms to directly engage with our hourly front-line associates to share DEI-related information and resources. We also are raising awareness of DEI and its importance by modernizing our learning materials; holding listening sessions where executives hear from associates across the organization; and focusing on recruiting and talent-planning strategies that emphasize diversity and inclusion.
On the community side, we are continuing to partner with local and national organizations focused on closing the wealth gap and advancing education for all. We continue to amplify our supplier diversity efforts to drive innovation, economic opportunities and shareholder value by directing more of our dollars, directly and indirectly, toward diverse businesses. We look to partner with organizations like the Billion Dollar Roundtable whose mission aligns with our focus areas. To further our commitment to supplier diversity, we are also seeking to achieve $5 billion in direct annual spend with diverse suppliers by 2025. See Page 60 to learn more about our supplier diversity efforts. What project excites you? I’m excited about our plans to expand Our Retool Your School program in 2023, which has provided campus beautification funding to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) since 2009. By expanding the reach of this program, we can further strengthen our commitment to HBCUs and their students, including through career development opportunities. (Learn more on Page 62).
Mission Statement. 
The Home Depot ignites the doer in all of us to build a culture of understanding, acceptance and appreciation.
Vision Statement. 
The Home Depot is building a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, within our enterprise and the communities we are proud to serve. Grounded in our core values, we have the conviction, capabilities and tools to make a difference for our associates, community partners and suppliers.

Our diverse workforce strengthens our competitive advantages and reflects the customers and communities we serve. A comparison against U.S. Department of Labor data shows that our U.S. workforce is more ethnically diverse than the nation’s working population. In 2021, we also expanded the number and percentage of women and minorities at the manager level and above. These charts reflect the demographics of The Home Depot’s U.S. workforce from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021. Certain percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding or, in 2020 and 2021, some associates choosing not to self-identify by race/ethnicity or gender. 2019 percentages included these non-disclosing associates in the white or male categories, as applicable.

ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT. 
Voice of the Associate Survey Highly engaged associates care about their work and the performance of The Home Depot. Our passion is to create an engaging and inclusive workplace; we do so by proactively engaging with our associates, while also listening and responding to their feedback. In 2021, we introduced an additional Voice of the Associate survey to all our associates. Our two Voice of the Associate surveys – Census and Pulse – provided us the opportunity to hear from our associates at least twice in 2021. Our Census survey is an annual in-depth look at our associate’s engagement and satisfaction with their job and with the Home Depot, while our Pulse survey is typically shorter and seeks feedback on specific topics. Based on the Voice of the Associate 2021 Census survey, we saw the highest engagement numbers across the enterprise that we have seen in the past few years. In addition, we also added two additional surveys – Onboarding and Exit, into our “Lifecycle Listening” toolbelt. These additional surveys allow us to intentionally connect with associates at specific moments within their career at The Home Depot.
Engagement Platform. 
In 2021, our new associate engagement platform - Yammer, which was launched at the end of fiscal 2020 - helped create new collaboration spaces and opportunities for reaching associates across the business. Whether through on-site desktops or on-the-go mobile devices, more than 450,000 associates across the U.S. and Canada have access to Yammer. With more than 650 active communities in the network, the digital hub links associates to both their local co-workers and corporate support across North America. It serves as a central hub to recognize associates for living our values, promote company news, cultivate connections between front-line and corporate associates and fuel the orangeblooded entrepreneurial spirit that’s part of what drives our business every day. Success Sharing and Compensation Enhancements Our philosophy of taking care of our people and motivating them to deliver a superior customer experience shapes our profit-sharing program for hourly associates. Success Sharing provides semi-annual cash awards for performance against our business plan, including sales and productivity goals. The program has granted awards totaling more than $1 billion to associates over the last two years. The outstanding performance of our associates in fiscal 2021 enabled 100% of stores to qualify for Success Sharing in both the first and second half of the year. This resulted in record award payments to our non-management associates of approximately $739 million.
We also continue to make investments in our associates – recent actions include our decision at the end of 2020 to transition our COVID-related enhanced associate pay and benefits to permanent compensation enhancements for frontline, hourly associates. In addition, we continued matching contributions under our FutureBuilder 401(k) Plan, and meritbased salary increases.
Associate engagement is the emotional connection associates have to our company and our goals. It is vital to The Home Depot’s culture and success.
Associate Engagement. 
DID YOU KNOW In 2021, Home Depot’s Yammer network was recognized as the #1 Yammer network among large organizations in the Americas by SWOOP Analytics.
ASSOCIATE ENGAGEMENT. 
Our People: Pay Equity. 
The Home Depot’s commitment to doing the right thing and taking care of our people extends to our pay practices. To ensure that we are paying our associates fairly, we conduct an annual analysis of our pay and compensation practices for our U.S. associates (who comprise approximately 89% of our workforce), in consultation with expert third-party firms following industry-leading standards. Our review of our U.S. associates’ total W-2 compensation for calendar year 2021, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, showed that, adjusting for relevant factors such as tenure, position, location and hours worked, associates who identified as female earned approximately 101% of what male associates earned, and associates who identified as members of a racial or ethnic minority earned approximately 99% of what non-minority associates earned. Not adjusting for those factors, our analysis showed that the median annualized W-2 pay for U.S. associates who identified as female was 98% of the median for men, and that the median pay for racial/ ethnic minority associates in the U.S. was 94% of the median for non-minority associates. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is tasked with providing oversight of our human capital management strategy and our diversity and inclusion efforts, receives regular updates on these findings. We will continue to strive to ensure equal pay across our organization.

We have seven U.S. ARGs, each supporting the company’s business objectives and policies, particularly those related to developing our associates, creating diversity awareness and engaging diverse community partners. In 2021, we revised our ARG structure to further support the career development of associates who voluntarily lead these groups. We also achieved our goal of expanding associate resource groups to include more of our people. We hosted more than 70 ARG events virtually in 2021 to celebrate diversity, raise cultural awareness and foster professional development. We continue to expand outreach to associates to encourage their engagement in our ARGs.
DID YOU KNOW The Home Depot was named to Forbes’ list of Best Employers for Diversity in 2019, 2021 and 2022.
SPOTLIGHT: C.A.R.E. TALKS. 
We launched Caring Conversations in 2020 in response to the unrest in our community. The virtual events for all associates included panel discussions where senior company leaders shared candid stories about race and ethnicity, and experts from outside our company educated associates about civil rights, laws, voting and more. In 2021, Caring Conversations evolved into C.A.R.E. Talks, a series of diversity discussions that Champion Awareness, Respect, and Equity for all associates. These discussions include external speaker series, panel discussions, and small group listening sessions, and we occasionally partnered with our Associate Resource Groups on elevating keynote speakers in this format. At the enterprise level, we hosted 13 C.A.R.E. Talks in 2021. These diversity discussions will be expanded to include additional formats in 2022. Comments from Associate Feedback Survey:
Supplier Diversity Panel: “The impact HD and many of its suppliers have on making their associates have better lives is inspiring and heartfelt. Love working for and with folks that care. Pun intended.” HBCU Panel: “The alignment between THD’s values and the values instilled in students attending HBCUs resonated with me. As an HBCU alum, my experience was similar to the panelists’ experiences, i.e. earning a values-based education in addition to the academics.” Ken’s Krew Program: “The sheer pride that poured out of that young man and his mother literally made my day. We take for granted sometimes the roles we have and this was a nice reminder.” (Learn more on Page 59)

Our Home Depot University, now in its 12th year, is critical to the development of values-based leaders who take care of our associates, customers, and communities.

Military service members and military spouses are resilient, resourceful and team-minded. Supporting them is the right thing to do for our communities and our company. FOCUSING ON THOSE WHO SERVE. 
SPOTLIGHT. 
Honoring those who serve or who have served us is fundamental to our ESG pillar of Strengthening our Communities. Our focus on the military community and their families includes the tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses in our workforce. Through our recently expanded Military Relations department, we look for ways to make The Home Depot an employer of choice for military members, veterans and their families. One of those veterans is Pete Capel, who has created a 30+ year career with The Home Depot. Like his father who served in the Navy during WWII, Pete joined the Marine Corps in 1983. During his 7-year military career maintaining radar systems, he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal twice, an award that recognizes outstanding achievement or meritorious service and is recognized across all military branches. After Pete left the Marine Corps in 1990, he began to think about what was next in his life. That’s when his story with The Home Depot started in the most unlikely of ways. Pete was getting his hair cut when Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, Home Depot co-founders, appeared on TV. As they were talking about how the company got started, Pete looked up and saw that there was a Home Depot store across the street. After his appointment ended, Pete walked over and immediately applied for a job. Pete was originally employed as a store sales associate in the electrical department. Since then, he’s held positions of increasing responsibility over his 30-year career. Today, he’s the vice president of field merchandising for the northern, southern, and western divisions.
Just as Pete did more than 30 years ago, Richard Cranford and Aminah Meho recently left careers in the Army and Air Force, respectively, and found new opportunities with The Home Depot. Through programs like Hiring our Heroes, The Home Depot partners with organizations that support military members who are transitioning into a second career and can help veterans find a role they enjoy.
Made-to-Fit Benefits. 
The Home Depot offers specialized benefits for veterans, military service members and military spouses who are Home Depot associates: • Military leave of absence for reservists, National Guard, and active-duty associates • Differential pay when activated or deployed • Fellowships for transitioning service members • Military family international leave of absence • Military Spouse Relocation program for hourly associates • Over 5,000 remote eligible jobs that can be relocated with military moves • Support resources, such as counselors, financial advisers and childcare assistance directories. 
CHECK IT OUT The Home Depot supports associates who are spouses of military members with flexible hours to help address the unique challenges the military might bring. Hear from military spouse and 6-year associate Alexis (Lexi) Strom on how The Home Depot’s flexible hours helped her balance family responsibilities during the pandemic.

ASSOCIATE SAFETY. 
The Home Depot strives to provide the safest working and shopping environment for our associates and customers. A major component in the strategy is raising awareness of risks among both frontline associates and leaders. When our people are trained to recognize and correct hazards, our workplace is primed for continual improvement.
Safety Takes EveryONE In 2021 we launched an awareness campaign called Safety Takes EveryONE. This message exemplifies that everyone, at all levels of the organization, must contribute to the safety of our associates and customers.
At the individual level of the campaign, each associate is provided tools to avoid risk, with every decision made, resulting in everyday safety. Safety Takes EveryONE is our rally cry to remind associates that safety is their most important responsibility and allows us to send everyone home safely.
The leader approach to Safety Takes EveryONE utilizes the acronym ONE. This second arm of the campaign focuses of our leaders’ efforts to increase awareness of the higher-risk injury categories.
The O is for Overexertion. 
Whether associates are handling product in a distribution center, receiving freight in a store, helping a customer load product into their vehicle or delivering bulky product to a jobsite, lifting too much or too frequently can result in injury. To prevent these injuries, we ask our leaders to engage with associates to create sustainable habits centered on our Lift it Close to Home ergonomic program. This program reminds individuals to minimize strain on their shoulders and back by anchoring the product lifted to their apron’s Home Depot logo, promoting safer lifting techniques.
The N is for New Hire Our focus is to ensure our newest associates are set up for safety success. Starting with their initial onboarding, we have simplified and prioritized safety training earlier in an associate’s experience to raise awareness around the riskiest tasks. We reinforce our onboarding program with monthly awareness topics and leader-driven engagements during the first six months of employment to allow associates to ask questions and provide feedback to improve safety. Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to engage with their associates early in their career to establish a positive safety culture.
The E is for Equipment Equipment is essential to all areas of our business and it is paramount that it is operated in a safe manner. Safety Takes EveryONE requires leaders to interact with associates through safety engagements focusing on the safe operations of both the driver and the associates working around the equipment. The results of these engagements are reviewed and shared with leaders to create a continuous improvement model. This heightened awareness drives innovation that will remove risk from our business and improve the safety within our stores and facilities. Safety is not one person’s responsibility, Safety Takes EveryONE to create an environment that fosters feedback, empowers our associates and leaders to make the safest decision, and allows every associate and customer to go home safely to their loved ones every day.
Our people are our most important assets. By focusing on workplace safety training and risk reduction, we help keep our associates and customers injury-free.

Operate Sustainably. 
The Home Depot uses the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which has been adopted by numerous companies worldwide to calculate metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to reduce them. We continually review and refine our emissions measurements to reflect changes to our business and improvements in data collection and reporting.
We participate in the CDP® reporting process. CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, is an independent, international, nonprofit organization that provides a global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share environmental information.
Our latest score of A- from CDP reflects our leadership and high level of action on climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency.
PROTECTING THE CLIMATE CARBON FOOTPRINT. 
Scope 1:
Direct emissions from combustible sources and refrigerants totaled approximately 642,000 metric tons.
Scope 2:
Indirect emissions from purchasing electricity totaled approximately 1,007,000 metric tons.
Scope 3:
We are currently assessing our Scope 3 emissions.
2021 RESULTS. 
Protecting the Climate: Carbon Footprint. 
By driving efficiencies and investing in green energy, we reduced our absolute combined Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by approximately 172,000 metric tons in 2021.
Under our science-based target goal linked to our annual CDP reporting, we have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions 2.1% per year to achieve a 40% reduction by 2030 and a 50% reduction by 2035. New this year, our annual GHG emissions and carbon intensities correspond to our fiscal year results, which will also be disclosed in our response to the annual CDP Climate Change questionnaire. Our results include data for HD Supply Holdings Inc., which we acquired on December 24, 2020.
In 2021, we decreased our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity. Our investments in efficiency helped us achieve a 21% reduction in the carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of revenue we earned, compared to 2020.
The Home Depot joined RE100 with our goal to produce or procure 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities by 2030. This action helps us move towards the company’s emission reduction targets.

PROTECTING THE CLIMATE STORE OPERATIONS. 
Running our stores more efficiently furthers both our business and sustainability goals. In 2021, we hit key milestones, including a 50% decrease in U.S. store electricity use since 2010. When we launched our store electricity conservation efforts a few years ago, we anticipated reducing U.S. store electricity use 20% over a decade. But by tapping into technologies and closely tracking and analyzing use, we were able to save more electricity than we originally imagined. (See chart.) In 2021 alone, we reduced year-over-year U.S. store electricity use approximately 11%. We learned a great deal from the progress we made reducing electricity use in our stores, and now we are applying our experience and proven strategies to conserving resources in other areas of our business, including electricity use in our supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Our successful energy conservation efforts have helped us move closer to our goal of producing or procuring 100% renewable electricity equivalent to the electricity needs for all Home Depot facilities worldwide by 2030.
LEDs Help Reduce Store Electricity Usage In 2021, we completed our multi-year project to upgrade U.S. stores to overhead LED lighting, retrofitting 383 stores in 2021 alone. Now LEDs light up nearly all our store aisles across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In the U.S., we have invested approximately $230 million in total capital expenditures on LED upgrades since 2018. Our U.S. stores with LEDs consume about 30% less electricity than similar stores with conventional lighting. Capitalizing on Solar’s Evolution Harnessing power from the sun is essential to our renewable electricity aims, and we’re making progress by buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms. In 2021, Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky began operating in Haskell County, Texas, west of Dallas, providing us with 75 megawatts of renewable electricity. We have agreed to purchase another 150 megawatts from companies building solar farms elsewhere in Texas. Once operating, we expect these commercial solar farms, in addition to our wind farm projects, to provide us with enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 500 Home Depot stores.
Protecting the Climate: Store Operations. 
By conserving resources we reduce business costs and our company’s impact on the environment.
Making Every kWh Count. 
The Home Depot reduced U.S. store electricity consumption 50% since 2010 through a multifaceted effort to find energy savings in every corner of the store. See our annual year-over-year progress below: 2021 2012 2011 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019.

Protecting the Climate: Store Operations. 
On average, fuel cells helped power 204 U.S. stores with more than 100% of their electricity needs annually.
The energy capacity we purchase from the Los Mirasoles Wind Farm in McAllen, Texas, is enough wind power to run 125 Home Depot stores.
PROGRESS ON POWER 800+ U.S. stores participate in demand mitigation to optimize our electricity costs during peak demand and help local utilities better manage grid capacity.
At 55 U.S. stores, on-site batteries store power during off-peak times for use when demand spikes.
Rooftop Solar Harvests Renewable Energy. 
We also help our customers harness the power of the sun. In partnership with Sunrun, we help our customers create clean and sustainable electricity.
CHECK IT OUT. 
Seeing the potential to use soccer-field-size space atop our stores to harvest the sun’s power, we installed our first rooftop solar farm in 2014. By the end of 2021, solar farms operated on 76 Home Depot stores and one distribution center in the U.S. In 2022, we’re increasing our emphasis on rooftop solar by: • Increasing the amount of roof space allocated to solar panels at our stores • Exploring possibilities for adding solar panels atop more distribution facilities. 
A pilot program launched in 2019 showed us the potential of using smart irrigation systems to save water at our stores. We rolled out the technology to 164 additional stores in 2021; 503 U.S. stores were using smart irrigation systems by the end of the year. On average, there is a 29% reduction in water used to irrigate landscaping, compared to stores with traditional timer-based irrigation systems.
Here’s how it works: In-ground sensors, real-time weather data and other data sources guide when sprinklers come on and how long they operate. So, a store’s landscaped areas are watered according to plants’ needs, rather than the clock.

Operate Sustainably 1. 
Added over 30 distribution centers - increasing speed and efficiency.
2. 
Moved approximately 6.9 billion cubic feet of products through our supply chain - a company record.
3. 
Reduced supply chain miles driven - despite moving record volume through our supply chain.
PROTECTING THE CLIMATE SUPPLY CHAIN. 
We continue to make progress on our multi-year supply chain initiative to create the fastest, most efficient and reliable delivery network for home improvement products. When we announced our approximately $1.2 billion supply chain initiative in 2017, we could have never envisioned the disruption to the global supply chain because of the pandemic. Due to our supply chain investments, however, we have demonstrated our ability to navigate any environment.
In addition, our supply chain investments have helped us move record amounts of product more efficiently. Despite seeing another year of record product volume move through our business, our new supply chain facilities helped us reduce the miles driven to get products from our vendors to our customers. Even as supply chain volume increased, the efficiencies we gained in our operations and our investments in green energy helped us reduce our carbon intensity. Learn more on Page 34.
We sell available space on our trucks and buy space from other companies, ensuring fewer underloaded trailers hit the road. That space sharing saves about 2 million driven miles a year.
By partnering with suppliers to forgo pallets, we can stack products to the top of trailers, resulting in a reduction in the number of truckloads needed to transport some goods.
WAYS WE’RE DRIVING SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS. 
In 2021, we installed hydrogen fuel cells at three U.S. supply chain facilities, giving us 15 locations with emissionsfree fuel for forklifts. We estimate these fuel cells helped us reduce electricity consumption by about 21 million kilowatt hours in 2021.
By making our supply chain more efficient, we reduce business costs and the impact that our product distribution has on the environment.
We do a technology-assisted assessment of scheduled pickups and deliveries, then recommend optimized routes to reduce miles traveled, fuel consumed and trucks on the road.
As we roll out our new distribution facilities, we’ve partnered with Plug Power to fuel some of our new facility’s material handling fleets, like forklifts, with zero-emission hydrogen fuel. This is another way we are reducing our environmental impact while building a best-in-class supply chain.
Optimization technology guides how we pack trucks or ocean-bound containers. We maximize the product load, reducing the number of truckloads and containers — and overall emissions.

SOURCING RESPONSIBLY ETHICAL SOURCING. 
We owe it to our customers, associates and communities to further the collective commitment to human rights, safety and environmentally sound practices through ethical sourcing. We engage our suppliers in this commitment by requiring them to produce products in factories that adhere to responsible sourcing standards. We report on our progress in an annual Responsible Sourcing Report. Our Responsible Sourcing Standards mandate that suppliers and factories abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacturing and distribution of merchandise or services provided to us. We conduct audits of factories around the world to ensure compliance with our responsible sourcing standards. Suppliers must maintain on-site documentation that demonstrates compliance with our responsible sourcing standards. They also must allow Home Depot associates and/or representatives full access to production facilities, worker records, production records and workers for confidential interviews in connection with monitoring visits. We expect our suppliers to promptly correct any noncompliance, starting with timely preparation and presentation of a corrective and preventative action plan. We also re-audit supplier facilities, with the frequency depending on their performance in prior audits.
If suppliers fail to improve, we may terminate our business relationships with them. Equally important, we support factories that take action to create lasting social and environmental compliance programs. We encourage suppliers and factory workers to communicate concerns via processes outlined in our corporate Code of Conduct.
Our responsible sourcing audits are designed to assess compliance in these areas: • Laws and regulations • Child labor • Forced labor • Harassment and abuse • Compensation • Hours of work • Non-discrimination • Freedom of association and collective bargaining • Health and safety • Environment • Subcontracting • Communication • Business ethics • Monitoring and compliance. 
We support suppliers that take action toward maintaining our collective commitment to human rights and safety in our supply chain.

CONFLICT MINERALS. 
SOURCING RESPONSIBLY. 
Through our due diligence process, which aligns with guidance from the Organisation for Economic CoOperation and Development, we received 100% participation from our in-scope private brands and proprietaryproduct Tier 1 suppliers.
Sixty-two percent of our in-scope Tier 1 suppliers indicated that one or more conflict minerals were necessary to the functionality or production of covered products, up from 32% in 2020. Of the smelters or refiners reported by these suppliers, only 48 out of a total of 311 uniquely identified smelters or refiners sourced conflict minerals from covered countries. Forty-three of these smelters or refiners were certified as DRC conflict-free by the Responsible Minerals Initiative, the London Bullion Market Association and/or the Responsible Jewellery Council.
We continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing; obtain current, accurate and complete information about the supply chain; and encourage their smelters to obtain a “conflict-free” designation from an independent thirdparty auditor.
We work with our suppliers to ensure they implement responsible sourcing and encourage their smelters to obtain “conflict-free” designations.
100% of our in-scope private brands and proprietaryproduct Tier 1 suppliers participated over the last three years in our efforts to collect conflict minerals information.
Sourcing Responsibly: Conflict Minerals. 
Our company expects all suppliers that manufacture our products to provide appropriate information and conduct due diligence to enable our compliance with conflict minerals laws. We also expect these manufacturers to obtain products and materials from suppliers that are not involved in funding conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining covered countries. We partner with our private brands and proprietary product suppliers whose products contain tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold (referred to as 3TG) to identify the source of any of these minerals in the supply chain.
2021 Progress. 
As detailed in The Home Depot’s Conflict Minerals Report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021, our efforts focused on collecting and disseminating information about the sourcing practices of our suppliers. We cataloged that information in a database using the conflict minerals reporting template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative®.

SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY. 
SOURCING RESPONSIBLY. 
The Home Depot’s focus on selling products made from sustainable sources of wood dates to 1994, when certified-sustainable wood shelving first arrived in our aisles. We recognize the environmental impact our company can have on the world’s woodlands by working with suppliers that adhere to set standards of forest management and tree species selection. To help protect endangered forests and support efforts to preserve timber for future generations, we first issued our Wood Purchasing Policy in 1999. Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world. We know that responsible forest management is essential to protecting the health of our ecosystems, critical biodiversity and the more than one billion people who depend on forests for their livelihoods. The goal of our sustainable forestry efforts is to ensure timber and healthy forests remain available for future generations. We are proud of our ability to create positive change by encouraging sustainable forestry practices. We strive to better understand the social and economic effects that wood purchases have around the world, especially in regions with endangered forests.
Over the years, we have focused our efforts to ensure the protection of forests at highest risk. While we sell less than 2% of the roundwood cut worldwide, we believe our efforts have had an outsized impact on the industry. We source approximately 86% from North America, approximately 8% from South America, approximately 3% from Asia, and less than 1% from each of Europe, Africa, and Oceania.
We believe that through our ongoing work with suppliers to sustainably manage forests and the commitments listed in our Wood Purchasing Policy, we have helped to expand forest land coverage in North America. Through the sharing of best practices with suppliers and ongoing engagement with stakeholders, we seek to build upon the progress we’ve made to protect the world’s forests.
The positive impact of our work with suppliers can be seen in our results. We also source lumber from a number of the largest forestry companies in North America, which work with sustainable forest management organizations like Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and American Tree Farm to ensure their trees are being sourced sustainably. Suppliers of ours like Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC ) and Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC™) seek to be examples of forest restoration and show how private forest management can protect and restore the ecological attributes of the forest, and whose forestlands are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) as being well-managed forests. While we are proud of the progress we have made to promote sustainable forestry, we continue to assess opportunities to drive progress in this area.
To further our commitment to sustainable forestry and increased transparency, we recently committed to participating in the CDP forests questionnaire.
We strive to create transparency in how global forest resources are used in our products.

Sourcing Responsibly: Sustainable Forestry. 
Data-Driven Sourcing Understanding the world’s forest coverage by country helps guide our supply chain decisions. The vast majority of our wood product purchases originate from North America.
Seventeen percent of the world’s forests are in Canada and the United States, according to research by the United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization. The U.N.’s 2020 State of the World’s Forests report shows that more than half of the world’s forest coverage is in five countries: Russia (20%), Brazil (12%), Canada (9%), the U.S. (8%) and China (5%). The Home Depot’s Wood Purchasing Policy outlines our commitment to: • Give preference to the purchase of wood and wood products originating from certified, well-managed forests wherever feasible.
• Eliminate the purchase of wood and wood products from forest regions identified as endangered.
• Practice and promote the efficient and responsible use of wood and wood products.
• Promote and support the development and use of alternative environmental products.
• Not accept wood products from the Amazon or Congo Basin areas, Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, unless they’re Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified.
• Demand that our vendors and their suppliers of wood and wood products maintain compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to their operations and the products they manufacture.

Eco Actions We continue to look for ways to help our customers reduce their environmental impact through the projects they take on. Building on the progress we’ve made with our Eco Options program, in April 2021 we launched our new Eco Actions program, which provides our customers with the resources they need to take individual action on environmental issues. Our Eco Actions website provides customers with new content, insights and ideas from innovative partners to inspire sustainable action. Eco Action’s growing library of sustainable-DIY content includes: • Reducing emissions with battery- powered outdoor equipment • Installing a water-conserving shower faucet • Reducing waste through our tool repair services • Highlighting responsibly sourced wood products • Benefits of organic gardening Eco Actions is just another way we’re helping our customers make sustainable changes for the better by helping them create greener homes.
REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT GREENER PRODUCTS. 
Eco Options The Home Depot’s Eco Options program continues to help our customers identify products that have less of an impact on the environment and encourages our suppliers to provide more sustainable offerings. We launched Eco Options in 2007 in partnership with SCS Global Services, a leading, independent, third-party certification body that validates environmental claims. For a product to receive Eco Options classification, the supplier must document attributes that prove it has less of an impact on the environment than comparable products in the same category. Until all industries create and abide by a reporting formula that measures product attributes according to a common sustainability standard, we will continue to use our Eco Options program to help customers sort through green product claims.
Our greatest environmental impact comes from the products we sell, and our biggest opportunity to create change is helping customers live more sustainably.
CHECK IT OUT Our new Eco Actions website offers insights and ideas on how people can do their part in their homes and gardens to create meaningful change.
Reducing Environmental Impact: Greener Products. 
Focus on Forestry and Responsible Chemistry In addition to our Eco Options and Eco Actions programs, we focus our sustainable product efforts in two key areas relevant to our business: forestry and indoor air quality. In 1999, we established a Wood Purchasing Policy to help avoid wood products coming from forestland with a high conservation value. Since then, we have continued to update this policy, and have worked to lead our suppliers to understanding and practicing sustainable forestry throughout the world. And in 2017, we published our Chemical Strategy (see Page 46) to encourage the exclusion of certain chemicals from paint, flooring, insulation, household cleaning and paint removers. Our chemical strategy is an important part of our commitment to offer greener products.
DID YOU KNOW The Home Depot was honored with four Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Awards in 2021. These awards reflect our commitment to sustainable business practices. We are proud to serve as industry leaders in the design, manufacture, selection, and use of products that are safer for the environment.

Since we introduced Circularity as one of our Eco Options’ pillars in 2019, our focus has been to prevent products and packaging from becoming waste throughout the product lifecycle. The foundation of Circularity comes from nature: nothing is wasted, and everything is regenerative. We strive to offer products with a positive environmental impact, and we encourage suppliers to innovate in how they produce and package products for reuse and longevity. We carry millions of products, and many have the potential to move our economy toward circularity. We also look for opportunities within Home Depot operations to reduce, repair, reuse and recycle. The goal is to extend our planet’s natural resources and protect land and water from the impact of material disposal.

Operate Sustainably. 
The Home Depot’s packaging team works with our private-label product suppliers to apply science to creating better packaging. Our goal is to reduce package footprints and use more sustainable materials to secure and protect the private-label products we sell. From 2017 through 2021, our packaging innovations allowed us to redesign 652 packages to reduce size and materials.
In 2021, our packaging team continued to innovate as they undertook a large project aimed at reducing packaging across our Crown Bolt products, Home Depot’s private brand of fasteners and building hardware. This project touched over 16 million packaging units, across nearly 300 SKUs.
REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING. 
Using Less EPS & PVC In 2021, our packaging team continued to find substitutes for expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) film in our private-label products. EPS foam is good at protecting products from damage, but it contains beads of chemicals and oil that are often difficult to recycle and can take more than a century to biodegrade. We continue to look across our privatelabel products to find even the smallest amounts of EPS and replace it with easier-to-recycle materials like molded pulp and paper. PVC film is a thin, rigid synthetic plastic polymer that’s molded around products to secure and protect them. But, like EPS, it is tough to recycle and takes a long time to break down naturally, and we’re working hard to use less of it. In 2020, we committed to eliminating EPS foam and PVC film from our privatelabel packages by 2023, prompting us to dig even deeper for results.
Our packaging innovations reduce waste, increase shipping efficiency and decrease product damage. That’s good for the planet and our business.
Reducing Environmental Impact: Sustainable Packaging. 
We’re compressing EPS waste from our operations into foam blocks that can be repurposed into new products, such as insulation — keeping the material out of landfills. Meet the entrepreneurial associate who launched this initiative.
CHECK IT OUT 286 274,600 cubic feet of EPS foam was removed from our privatelabel packaging— enough to fill 138 school buses packages were redesigned to reduce size and materials 2021 BY THE NUMBERS 1,119,700 square feet of PVC film was eliminated— enough to cover 19 football fields

Our practice of engaging with our stakeholders on ESG topics helped us design a more sustainable packaging solution for some of our LED lightbulbs. In response to customer feedback, we have sought to remove the excess plastic from our ECOSMART LED bulb packaging. In this regard, our packaging team went to work looking for a new way to package the bulbs without the need for plastic. The redesign that our packaging team came up with helped eliminate the need for plastic in the packaging, while also reducing the size of the box.

James “Shack” Harris and Doug Williams, co-founders of the Black College Football Hall of Fame, wanted to address a major issue: Football players from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were not being drafted by NFL teams. Thus, they created the HBCU Legacy Bowl, a post-season all-star game showcasing some of the best draft-eligible football players attending historically black colleges and universities. The event is more than a football game. The Legacy Bowl’s career fair brings job opportunities and professional skills training like résumé writing and interview tips to juniors and seniors attending HBCUs.

At the Home Depot, we are committed to building inclusive and sustainable business opportunities for women, minority, veteran, disability and LGBTQ owned companies. Our Supplier Diversity program was established in 2003, with the goal of increasing shareholder value, driving innovation and creating positive impact in the communities we serve. We celebrate and invest in minority entrepreneurs because we understand their critical role in driving innovation, creating jobs and meaningful solutions in our communities. In 2021, we spent $3.3 billion with diverse suppliers, compared to $3.2 billion the previous year. Diverse businesses are identified as U.S.-based, for-profit and 51% or more owned, controlled and operated by U.S. citizens or people with U.S. permanent resident alien status that fall under one of the following categories: woman, ethnic minority, veteran, LGBTQ, individuals with a disability. In 2021, we launched a Tier II supplier diversity program designed to drive more spending from our direct Tier I suppliers to diverse businesses. We’re working to better ensure that a portion of the money we spend on products and services, even with suppliers that are not identified as diverse, makes its way to diverse enterprises. The Home Depot provides supplier development programs and mentoring to assist diverse suppliers with business growth, and we partner with organizations that provide certification, education and opportunities for capital and networking.

The Home Depot has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance, which promotes the longterm interests of shareholders, strengthens Board and management accountability, and helps build public trust in the company.
Our Board of Directors has adopted policies and processes that foster effective Board oversight of critical matters such as strategy, risk management, financial and other controls, compliance, culture, ESG, and management succession planning.
At least once a year, our Board discusses our sustainability strategy and activities, including this report.
Leadership Structure On at least an annual basis, the Board assesses its leadership structure, including the appointment of the Chair of the Board. Our Lead Director is annually elected by the independent members of the Board. For the past several years, having a combined chairman and CEO, an independent Lead Director, and Board committees composed entirely of independent directors, together with other robust corporate governance practices, has provided strong independent oversight of management while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the company. In early 2022, in connection with our CEO succession process, the Board split the CEO and Chair roles to support the leadership transition. Our former CEO, Craig Menear, remained as Board Chair following the appointment of Ted Decker as CEO and President. The independent members of the Board will continue to assess the Board leadership structure over time and determine what best supports the company’s needs.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. 
Our corporate governance policies reflect best practices:
Shareholder Protections • Annual election of directors with majority voting standard in uncontested director elections • Shareholder ability to call special meetings and act by written consent • A market standard shareholder right of proxy access • Independent Lead Director • Approximately 86% of directors and all Board committee members are independent • Director mandatory retirement age (age 72) • No shareholder rights plan, also referred to as a “poison pill”
Board Engagement and Oversight • Annual Board strategy session and review of the company’s strategic plan • Director overboarding policy • Store-walk policy for directors • Board education and orientation program • Annual Board and committee selfevaluations, including individual director interviews • Management succession policy set forth in Corporate Governance Guidelines • Independent directors meet without management. 
We understand our responsibility to behave ethically, to understand the impact we have on people and communities, and to fairly consider the interests of a broad base of stakeholders.

Board Committees. 
Our Board of Directors has established four standing committees, each comprised solely of independent directors and governed by a written charter that sets forth its purpose, composition, powers, duties and responsibilities.
Board Oversight of Risk. 
The company has a robust framework designed to identify and ensure proper management of risk, including risk related to our ability to operate responsibly and sustainably. The framework that we use to identify and manage risk considers a number of enterprise-level issues, including competitive environment, brand and reputation, regulatory and compliance, and security, as well as external and internal factors that could distract the Company from our business or derail our strategic objectives. The Board oversees risk through this framework, with oversight accomplished by identifying key risks and mapping them to the appropriate Board Committee or to the full Board.
Our Board reviews these key risks and the related framework annually, and the full Board or appropriate Board committees discuss selected risks in more detail throughout the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, its related risks and its impact on our enterprise risk framework. The table below identifies key risk areas overseen by the Board and its committees.

We actively participate, and encourage our associates to participate, in the political process. Our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy provides the framework for our political activity. We engage in three key ways: • Our Government Relations department protects and expands our company’s ability to take care of our associates, customers and shareholders through effective regulatory and legislative action. Our Government Relations team works to optimize the government’s impact on the business through effective lobbying, relationship building and political engagement.
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS • We have a political action committee (PAC) that connects our salaried associates to the political process and pools their personal contributions to financially support pro-business candidates who understand issues of importance to The Home Depot and our associates. As a long-standing practice, we do not contribute to presidential campaigns or endorse presidential candidates.
The Home Depot recognizes that laws at the federal, state and local level impact our business.
Government Relations • The Home Depot supports trade associations that advocate on behalf of the business community and retail sector and reports annually the aggregate dues paid to those associations that engage in lobbying activities.
For the first time, The Home Depot has created an Economic Impact interactive map that highlights the importance of its business in communities around the country. The Economic Impact map, which was created in collaboration in collaboration between our Government Relations, Tax and Strategic Business Development teams, along with PwC, includes information about employment numbers, taxes, community involvement, and donations of critical COVID-19 supplies. The map gives a state-by-state breakdown so customers and associates can easily see the impact in their communities.

In deciding where we want to focus our advocacy, these are some of our top priorities: • Driving sales by ensuring online-only marketplaces follow the same rules on accountability and transparency as interconnected retailers • Supporting our Supply Chain initiative by advocating for funding for roads, ports and bridges and for laws that allow safer, heavier trucks to reduce loads and our environmental footprint • Growing margin dollars by working to get laws passed that target sophisticated, organized retail crime rings to reduce theft and support free trade • Taking care of our people by making sure we have a say in laws that could affect associate flexibility and career growth

Oversight of Our Political Activity. 
Our Government Relations department, led by a vice president who reports to our general counsel, manages our political activity. The team carefully analyzes our engagement activities, trade association partnerships, and political contributions for alignment with our key priorities, guided by our Core Values. All of The Home Depot’s political contributions are made to promote the interests of the company and without regard for the private political preferences of executives or directors. The Government Relations team is responsible for ensuring all PAC and corporate political contributions are made in accordance with the law and company policies. The team participates in regular trainings and performs routine reviews to monitor compliance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors provides additional oversight, conducting an annual review of our Political Activity and Government Relations Policy, the company’s political contributions and payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee must approve in advance any public advertisement directly or indirectly paid for by the Company that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate in which Home Depot is identified specifically as an advocate of such election or defeat. To date, the company has not made any expenditure for such electioneering communications, and has no present plans to make any such expenditures. The Home Depot PAC’s finances, governance and communications are governed by a PAC Board. The PAC Board is chaired by the vice president of Government Relations and is made up of representatives from each functional area of the business and each field division to ensure a wide range of experiences and perspectives. We provide transparency in our actions by publishing an annual report of the company’s political contributions and the aggregate dues paid to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities, and any independent political expenditures by the Company supporting or opposing ballot initiatives and contributions to ballot measures committees. We list trade associations to which our company makes yearly payments of $5,000 or more, and our PAC contributions are publicly available on the Federal Election Commission website.

Here are the primary, business-focused criteria the PAC considers when deciding which candidates to support: • Service on key committees important to The Home Depot • Favorable position on one or more legislative issues that align with The Home Depot’s business objectives • Service in a current or potential leadership position • Location of a Home Depot facility in the candidate’s district • Industry support from business and retail organizations.
