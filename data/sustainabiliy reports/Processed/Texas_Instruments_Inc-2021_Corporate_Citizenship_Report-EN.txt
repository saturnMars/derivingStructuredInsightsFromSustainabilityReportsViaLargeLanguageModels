Rich Templeton Chairman, President and CEO. 
For decades, Texas Instruments has operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. With each generation, technology has become more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, with semiconductors used by a growing number of customers and markets.
Our founders had the foresight to know that building a great company required a special culture to thrive for the long term. For many years, we’ve run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind: • First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades.
• Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that’s ever changing.
• And third, we will be a company that we’re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor.
Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.
In 2021, despite the ongoing global challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained a focus on keeping our employees safe, supporting our customers and giving back to our communities when needs continued to be great. I continue to be proud of how TIers adapted and performed. We have learned through the decades that challenging years are when our ambitions are most critical in guiding our decisions.
It is a privilege to get to pursue our passion of creating a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. With our ambitions guiding our decision-making for the long-term and our products helping create a better world, we are confident that our collective efforts will be impactful and long-lasting.

Our commitment to corporate citizenship Report overview. 
We take great pride in being a good corporate citizen, which impacts our communities and the world in two ways: • First, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Central to these ambitions is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term.
• Second, semiconductors will play a critical role in creating a better world and helping reduce the impact on the environment.
Since 2006, TI has published program information, goals, progress on goals and relevant data – including a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability priorities – as part of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen. As with previous years, our 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report provides insight into how we think about – and how we perform – in various ESG areas relevant to our business using these widely accepted reporting frameworks: • The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).2 • The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).3 • The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).4. 
In addition, we participate in the CDP5 Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires and make both available at TI.com/ccr.
To strengthen our reporting, we solicit input from internal and external stakeholders year-round, examine third-party sustainability assessments, and benchmark trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.
2The GRI is an independent, international organization that helps businesses take responsibility for their impacts by providing them with a global common language to communicate those impacts.
3The Financial Stability Board established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions.
4The SASB is an independent nonprofit organization that sets standards to guide the disclosure of sustainability information by companies to their investors.
5The CDP is a nonprofit that runs the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to manage their environmental impacts.

Reducing environmental impact. 
We manufacture billions of semiconductors that we sell to more than 100,000 customers all over the world. We designed our long-term environmental sustainability program to conserve natural resources, reduce emissions and mitigate environmental impacts.
We have had a long-standing commitment to responsible, sustainable manufacturing. Our focus is on; improving energy efficiency; reducing GHG emissions; reducing waste; and reusing more water. Specifics on these areas can be found in the following pages.
Progress. 
As part of TI’s commitment to reducing environmental impact, TI sets goals to reduce GHG emissions, energy intensity per chip, waste and increased water conservation.
Over the past several years, TI has made progress towards our long-term goal of reducing scope 1 and scope 2 absolute GHG emissions by 25% from a 2015 base year and will continue working towards the successful achievement of this goal by 2025.
In 2021 TI’s production increased by ~20% compared to the prior year, due to high customer demand from the ongoing global challenges related to the pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions. While we had year-over-year increases in key areas, they did not increase at the same rate as production. We remain committed to achieving our 2025 GHG emissions and energy intensity goals, and are investing in the actions listed within the report to reduce our environmental impact.
As a semiconductor company that manufactures billions of chips per year, we believe it is critical to drive efficiencies in our fabrication process. Measuring per chip improvements tells the greater story in our efforts to improve overall efficiency. On page 7, we include an overview of our actions, goals and progress in four key areas of environmental sustainability - GHG emissions, energy, water and waste – and we include an overview of the per chip efficiencies we’ve recognized over the past 11 years. As we continue to expand our 300-millimeter (300-mm) manufacturing, and the advanced manufacturing technology in these wafer manufacturing plants, the efficiencies recognized will continue to positively impact our environmental footprint.

In 2021, TI once again received recognition for sustainable business practices: • Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies.
• Dow Jones Sustainability Index, North America.
• Newsweek’s America’s Most Responsible Companies.
• The Wall Street Journal’s Top Companies for Social Responsibility.

Environmental commitments. 
Making chips more efficiently. 
Being a manufacturer of billions of chips a year, it is critical that we do so efficiently and with a commitment to continued improvement. One way we measure our success is on a per-chip basis in four key areas of sustainability: energy, water, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We also invest in 300-mm advanced analog manufacturing facilities. These investments will enable us to reduce emissions, and increase water and energy efficiency.
2021 per-chip efficiency improvements. 
TI has been working for years to drive efficiencies in its fabrication processes and equipment to reduce materials consumption; water, chemical and energy use; and associated air and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. When comparing our perchip data from 2010 to 2021, TI has reduced its manufacturing-related impacts and resource consumption.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
TI actions to reduce emissions: • Use alternative gases and chemicals. • Install emissions abatement devices. • Purchase electricity from renewable energy sources. • Optimize product manufacturing, shipping and distribution. • Avoid unnecessary business travel and subsidize employee commuting at certain sites.

Energy Water GHG Emissions Waste -39% -63% -50% -51% 2010-2021: Per-chip* efficiency improvements *Normalized, or per-chip efficiency data, is a way to develop a baseline and track changes in energy, water, GHG and material consumption based on the number of chips manufactured each year. We measure GHG emissions intensity to assess the overall GHG efficiency of our manufacturing processes. GHG emissions refer to the total GHGs emitted, which depend on the amount of production. GHG emissions intensity attempts to normalize usage by looking at GHG emissions per unit of output (by dividing our total GHG emissions by our total production). This same definition applies to water and waste intensity per chip data.
To minimize environmental impacts, TI implements strategies to reduce water consumption, waste and greenhouse gas emissions. These are summarized below along with the progress we are making towards our reduction goals.
6TI’s 2015 GHG emissions baseline was adjusted in 2022 to reflect structural changes to our operations, including the divestiture of a wafer fabrication plant in Scotland and the acquisition of a 300-mm wafer fabrication plant in Utah. The 2015 baseline has been adjusted from 2,471,357 to 2,832,709 in line with the guidance provided by the WBCSD/WRI’s The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.

Scope 3. 
TI’s supply chain, employee travel and commuting, and product distribution network generate scope 3 GHG emissions. We lessen these impacts by: • Encouraging suppliers to optimize their production and operational efficiencies.
• Shipping items in bulk from regional distribution centers to reduce the number of shipments and transportation-related emissions.
• Limiting business travel and providing videoconferencing capabilities. We have significantly reduced employee travel and commuting emissions through compliance with government-mandated gathering restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Providing on-site electric vehicle charging stations, shuttles and biking infrastructure.
• Subsidizing mass transit and carpooling at select sites.
We are in the process of estimating and calculating the value chain emissions that are significant to TI in line with the Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (a supplement to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard). For more information about TI’s GHG emissions reduction strategies, see TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response.
ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING. 
For years, we have taken steps to reduce GHG emissions in our operations, shipping and distribution, as well as through our supply chain.
Scope 1. 
TI directly emits scope 1 GHG emissions from gases used in the manufacturing process and fuels consumed on-site, such as natural gas and diesel. We are working to reduce these emissions by: • Installing efficient manufacturing technologies.
• Eliminating nonessential fluorinated gases and using alternative gases and chemicals.
• Installing thermal point-of-use abatement devices on some tools that treat the exhaust gases used in semiconductor manufacturing.
Scope 2. 
TI indirectly emits scope 2 GHG emissions from electricity purchased for manufacturing or other operations. We are working to reduce these emissions by: • Purchasing and securing renewable energy sources around the world.
• Increasing the energy efficiency of our manufacturing systems, buildings and tools.
Monitoring potential risks. 
TI faces potential risks and opportunities associated with environmental issues. To learn about our environmental-related risks and opportunities, governance, management strategies and emissions, see TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response, the ESH Management Approach and Emissions Management Approach sections of the GRI Index, and our TCFD Index.
Climate-rated scenario analysis. 
In 2021, TI hired Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to conduct a climate-related scenario analysis; they presented results of their analysis in early 2022. Over the next year, several working teams comprising subject-matter experts will review ERM’s findings.

Optimizing efficiency. 
Annually, TI implements projects aimed at reducing overall energy use throughout our operations. Without these projects and the projects implemented in prior years, energy use in a year when production increased by ~20% would have been higher than the 3.19 terawatt hour (TWh) we used in 2021. TI will continue to implement meaningful projects, ensuring we further improve our energy efficiency.
• We implement more than 200 energy efficiency projects each year to reduce GHG emissions and energy costs.
• Over the last five years, we conserved nearly 300,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy.
Energy. 
TI’s global operations, design, manufacturing, assembly and test sites focus on lowering energy consumption and associated GHG emissions by setting annual reduction goals and implementing efficiency projects.
ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING. 
We focus most of our efforts on our manufacturing operations because they account for over 90% of our total energy use. We set annual reduction goals and implement efficiency9 projects to improve energy efficiency. Other ways that we save energy include: • Designing and operating buildings and fabrication sites to optimize efficiency.
• Upgrading and refurbishing tools and equipment.
• Using sensors and other automated controls.
• Implementing energy conservation projects.
• Improving control and optimizing set points of our chilled water plants.
• Installing energy-efficient LED lighting.
• Making our air handling systems more efficient by installing more efficient fans and drive mechanisms.
For more information about how TI manages energy use, see the ESH Management Approach and Energy sections of the GRI Index.
Our commitment to reducing energy intensity per chip. 
By 2025, TI has a goal to reduce energy use per chip by 50% at worldwide manufacturing sites from a 2015 base year. At year-end 2021, we achieved a 33% reduction toward this goal.
In the U.S., TI voluntarily participates in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants program. After achieving our initial goal, we set a stretch goal to reduce normalized primary10 energy per pattern at U.S. manufacturing sites by 50% by 2020. We continued to make progress in 2021, reducing energy intensity by 42.3%, improving from 40.6% in 2020.

ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING. 
Annually, TI implements projects aimed at reducing overall water use throughout our operations. Without these projects and the projects implemented in prior years, water use in a year when production increased by ~20% would have been higher than the 7.57 billion gallons we used in 2021. TI will continue to implement meaningful projects, ensuring we further improve our water efficiency.
Conserving water. 
To reduce water consumption, TI: • Invests in reduction, recycling and reuse projects.
• Improves the efficiency of our deionized water plants, such as optimizing the recovery rates of our reverse-osmosis filters.
• Reduces manufacturing tool water use by optimizing flow rates and identifying where water can be reused in other processes.
• Uses additional microfilters and ultrafilters to recover more wastewater.
• Maximizes the amount of condensate and microfiltration water directed to cooling towers.
• Reuses water with high salt or mineral content (produced as a byproduct of our ultra-pure water system) for toilet flushing.
• Reuses water in our cooling towers.
• Purifies and recycles higher-quality production water back to the inputs of our ultra-pure water plants.
Water management. 
Because water is an essential part of manufacturing semiconductors, TI has a particular focus on using water responsibly and efficiently. Conserving process and potable water and treating and recycling wastewater enables us to reduce costs, protect water quality and promote long-term availability. We maintain and optimize our wastewater treatment systems to comply with regulations and permit limits.
Managing wastewater. 
TI has internal standards, programs and procedures to ensure that stormwater and wastewater produced by all sites comply with local, state and national discharge requirements. Parameters evaluated by each site are standard for the semiconductor industry and typically include biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, metals, pH and temperature. We also: • Restrict or remove substances such as metals, toxic organic compounds, nitrates and sulfides from wastewater before discharge.
• Collect wastewater sludge containing solvents, concentrated metals or acid solutions and dispose of them off-site per regulatory requirements. In some cases, we send these compounds to reclamation facilities for reuse by other industries.
• Conduct required wastewater sampling to make sure that we are operating within our permit limits.
• Take additional precautions, in compliance with local laws, at sites in Malaysia, the Philippines and Japan because treated wastewater discharges directly into a water body in these countries instead of a municipal treatment facility.
Monitoring water quality. 
Water withdrawal quality is regularly monitored at all of our manufacturing facilities. To confirm water quality, regular testing is conducted to ensure internal standards are maintained. Water discharge quality by standard effluent parameters is tracked across our manufacturing facilities.
To learn more about our water and effluent management strategies, see TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response and the ESH Management Approach and Water and Wastewater Management Approach sections of the GRI Index.
Water conservation goal. 
In 2021, we implemented water reduction projects that saved an annualized amount of water equal to 2.8% of our 2020 usage, exceeding our goal of 2.6%.

Waste and material management. 
TI responsibly manages the use and disposal of materials and chemicals to protect the environment and reduce landfill waste.
ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING. 
We properly dispose of waste and materials that we cannot recycle or reuse per applicable federal, state and local laws, and make every effort to:
Step 1: Examine what we need.
Most of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting waste, and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead.
Step 2: Reuse what we can.
We reuse materials and chemicals by: • Recovering metals from solids, liquids, scrap wafers and other materials.
• Repurposing and reselling used and surplus chemicals, chemical containers and older manufacturing equipment.
• Reusing wafer carriers and food service tableware.
Step 3: Recycle what is allowed.
Our recyclable material and chemicals come primarily from our offices and manufacturing sites. These are managed and regulated differently depending on local requirements.
Managing chemicals and gas use. 
Manufacturing semiconductors involves using hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals and gases, which is why TI’s product-management systems have stringent controls in place. We continually: • Identify and use the safest, lowest-risk materials in operations to protect TIers, site communities and consumers. Where possible, we use high-pressure water instead of chemicals in certain cleanup applications or replace chemicals with environmentally benign substitutes.
• Screen all incoming materials and chemicals before incorporating them into semiconductor manufacturing processes to comply with regulatory and customer requirements. We also incorporate any chemical restrictions and standards into supplier contracts.
• Assess potential ESH impacts of materials as new scientific information becomes available and new regulations go into effect.
• Follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely.
• Provide specific procedures and training for the use, labeling, storage and disposal of chemicals or hazardous substances, including the proper use of personal protective equipment.
• Use ventilation controls, abatement systems, leak detectors and appropriate treatment technologies.
If concerns about a material or chemical arise during our screening process, we elevate the matter to our review board, comprising internal subject-matter experts. In the rare event that a material or chemical is necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, our manufacturing leaders review the situation and, if necessary, seek a safer alternative or implement more stringent use controls.
Performance. 
TI reused or recycled 90.1% of the 45,667 metric tons of waste and surplus materials generated in 2021. We achieved this through reusing and recovering chemicals where viable; selling surplus chemicals; recycling certain wastes for use in energy recovery; and recycling scrap wood, paper, glass, metals and organic materials.

Phasing out substances of concern. 
One challenge facing the electronics industry is reducing or eliminating the use of compounds that are essential but potentially harmful. These include: • Brominated and chlorinated flame retardants – while these compounds pose no risk in TI products as sold, their improper or unsafe disposal is of concern. Over the last two decades, we’ve proactively removed these chemicals from 99% of our products.
• Perfluorinated substances (PFOSs) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – these oil and water repellants cause potential health effects. TI stopped using PFOSs in 2015, and successfully finished our phase-out of PFOA and PFOA-related compounds in 2021.
TI, other chipmakers and some of their suppliers are participating in a new industry consortium to collect information to inform regulators about the broad spectrum of semiconductor uses of perfluoroalkyl substances.
For more information about how TI manages materials, see the ESH Management Approach and Materials sections of the GRI Index.
Transparency on product substances. 
We give customers documents and tools that outline measures we take to ensure that TI parts comply with global material restrictions and regulations. These include: • Controlled Chemical and Materials Specifications.
• List of TI-Restricted Chemicals and Materials.
• TI’s Approach to Environmental and Product Stewardship.
• A search tool to find material content, download restricted chemical test reports, or locate product RoHS, REACH and green status.
• Quality, Reliability and Packaging Data.
• Lead-Free Conversions.
• Low Halogen (Green) Statement.
• Environmental FAQs.

We are continuously improving our products and process technologies in order to deliver high-quality and reliable semiconductor solutions that meet our customers’ needs. TI’s holistic approach to quality permeates every aspect of the company’s supply chain from process technology and design through manufacturing, packaging, test and delivery. To reduce environmental impacts and extend product longevity, we optimize the quality and reliability of our technologies.
Quality and reliability. 
Every organization within TI works together to ensure quality and to deliver reliable products. We continuously improve our products and process technologies to build reliable technologies that meet stringent qualification standards for industrial (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) and automotive (Automotive Electronics Council Q100) products. We use specialized materials and controls to build highquality products, test silicon and package technologies and continuously monitor wafer-level reliability.
By the time we start product qualification, our goal is to have high, data-backed confidence that the product is fully reliable and will meet our customers’ long-term quality needs.
Product quality. 
Quality and reliability permeate every corner of TI. 
Our: • Quality System Manual describes quality-management processes and systems.
• Quality policy and procedures provide a framework to quickly identify and resolve quality issues. We incorporate industry requirements and standards, along with customer specifications and feedback, to mitigate risks and drive improvement throughout a product’s life cycle.
• Internal quality standards help us comply with numerous industry standards and quality specifications, including International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, International Standard for Automotive Quality Management Systems 16949 and the Underwriters Laboratories rating.
• Reliability testing enhances or accelerates potential fail mechanisms, helps identify the root cause and reveals how to prevent failure modes.
We measure several performance indicators of product and service quality to make continuous improvements.
Our commitment to quality and support. 
We measure customer returns, which assess our performance on both resolution cycle times and return parts per billion. These measures help maintain high levels of customer service and product quality and reliability. To drive continuous improvement, we assess, categorize and aggregate the reason for each return to identify systemic improvement opportunities. More than 85% of TI products have not had a single customer return in three years.
Product longevity. 
To maintain product longevity and continuity of supply for our customers, we have life-cycle management policies and inventory and manufacturing strategies that enable us to sell and support products for a decade or more.
TI’s product life cycles are typically 10 to 15 years and often extend longer, consistent with many customers’ requirements. We are committed to product longevity for our customers and have strategies and internal policies in place to uphold this commitment.

Packing and shipping. 
We pack and ship products efficiently in order to assure timely distribution to customers, comply with international shipping regulations and reduce environmental impact. For example, we: • Pack large quantities of products into each shipment to eliminate multiple deliveries. We also increase packing density to move actual weights closer to charged dimensional weights.
• Use air pillows in packaging that are recyclable, reusable and contain recycled content.
• Work with our customers to understand their delivery needs and ship in bulk when possible. This practice enables us to ship mutually agreed-upon low-priority freight when space becomes available on more affordable shipping options.
• Require that suppliers ship all new 300-mm wafers in reusable containers. When empty, we return these containers to the supplier for reuse or use them internally. In 2021 alone, we reused 21,628 of these containers.
• Reuse packing materials that protect products during shipment (such as bubble pack and foam), shipping materials (such as boxes, crates and pallets), cases that ship precious metal reclaimable items to suppliers, and plastic reels used in product distribution.
• Comply with the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and EU Packaging and Packaging Waste recycling programs for evaluation modules imported into that region.
• Place our product distribution centers in regions close to customers to accelerate delivery times, improve efficiency and facilitate product deliveries in the event of a disaster.
• Eliminate heavy and expensive custom-cut foam, nonrecyclable foam, and foam and cardboard waste.

Supply-chain responsibility. 
TI buys materials for fabrication processes; factory equipment and maintenance; logistics services; and nonproduction supplies and services from approximately 11,000 suppliers of various types and sizes. Our worldwide procurement team coordinates buying globally for various goods and services, including setting procurement strategies, identifying and vetting qualified suppliers, negotiating terms and pricing, and determining the best fulfillment methods. In the U.S., we also actively pursue business opportunities with minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) to drive economic equity.
Responsible sourcing. 
TI invests in driving sustainable and responsible business practices throughout its supply chain to mitigate risks in suppliers’ businesses, labor and environmental practices. For example, we: • Collect and carefully consider a supplier’s human rights practices and environmental and safety records before making purchasing decisions. We will not knowingly engage with a supplier that violates our values, code of conduct or other governing documents.
• Specify our performance requirements and expectations in our policies, contracts and purchase orders. Integrating responsible business practices into our supply chain helps mitigate risks.
• Seek suppliers that will create long-term shareholder value by scaling growth; reducing total costs and waste; improving efficiencies; and delivering innovative services, materials and product support.
Our supplier website includes more information about TI’s sourcing strategies, supplier risks and management system, requirements for doing business, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and our dedication to transparency. These documents also include content about how TI and third-party agencies annually evaluate supplier performance to ensure compliance with laws, standards and expectations. We disclose the findings of these audits in this Corporate Citizenship Report.

Performance. 
In 2021, TI assessed nearly 300 suppliers to determine their alignment with the RBA’s code of conduct, and to evaluate their ethics, environmental and social risks, including human rights and forced labor. Of those assessments, we evaluated 163 production suppliers that support our manufacturing operations with 360 factory locations; 99% met our expectations. The remaining 1% required corrective actions, which included additional training, enhanced policies or an improved work schedule.
Regardless of their respective risk rating, we require any supplier with actual or potential risks (such as those related to hiring activity, working hours, and wages and benefits) to take corrective actions. We monitor these actions through to completion.
Production suppliers rated as low risk for all facilities on environmental and social responsibility self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) assessments.
Responsible Business Alliance member. 
TI is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an industry coalition dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global supply chains, and is compliant with the standards outlined in the RBA code of conduct.

Doing business with diverse suppliers. 
TI engages U.S. minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) to provide the company with unique, innovative and cost-effective products and services. Much of our contracts are with Texas-based MWBEs that support our company headquarters and major manufacturing facilities. Our business relationships with MWBEs facilitate regional economic growth.
Each year, we set spend goals based on the types of projects we have planned and the availability of qualified MWBEs. Our percentage of spending with MWBEs includes support throughout our operations and projects such as our 300-mm semiconductor wafer fabrication plant expansion in Richardson, Texas. In 2021, our percentage of spending with MWBEs was 20.3%, and included both contracts related to day-to-day operations as well as our capacity expansion in Richardson. Excluding the contracts related to the Richardson expansion, our percentage of spending would have been 8.8%.

Our commitment to supporting MWBEs. 
From our initial involvement in the Dallas Together Covenant 30 years ago to our ongoing partnership with the Women’s Business Council – Southwest and the Dallas/Fort Worth Minority Business Development Council, TI actively supports MWBEs. Annually, we: • Mentor local MWBE owners to sharpen such skills as bidding on contracts, managing inventory, building supplier partnerships and diversifying their client base.
• Financially support the Lillie Knox Investment Award through the Women’s Business Council – Southwest, which invests up to $20,000 per recipient for expansion and business growth.
• Meet with existing MWBE owners to determine contract expansion opportunities and verify that they have a stable client base beyond our company.
• Engage with organizations such as the Dallas LGBTQ+ Chamber to further diversify our supplier base.

Conflict minerals. 
TI has processes to ensure that its products do not contain minerals derived from sources that finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. These minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.
ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING. 
We work diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate noncompliant material sources. Our standard operating procedures for Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Management conform with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance, which requires establishing policies, structures and procedures; risk management; and communications mechanisms. We distribute our Conflict Minerals Policy to both first- and second-tier suppliers and expect their full and prompt response to our information requests.
Performance. 
Over the past several years, we’ve relied primarily on the findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) to ensure that our supply chain is conflict-free. The RMAP is a program in which an independent third party evaluates smelters’ management systems and procurement practices and determines whether the smelter has demonstrated that all the materials it processed originated from conflict-free sources. TI has started taking steps to disclose the use of cobalt in its supply chain.
To date, none of the smelters evaluated from our research and information gathering are financing or benefiting armed groups. For more information about how TI manages conflict minerals, see our SEC form SD filing and Supplier Social Assessment in the GRI Index.
Tracing chain of custody. 
To gain insight into the country of origin, chain of custody and Conflict Status of the CMs in our supply chain, we relied primarily on the findings of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). RMAP is overseen by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which was established by members of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative. TI is a member of the RBA and working groups participating in both the Responsible Minerals Initiative and Responsible Labor Initiative.

Risk management and business continuity. 
Preparing for various scenarios. 
As a global corporation, TI faces unexpected global events that occur without warning, from earthquakes and pandemics to severe weather events. The impact of these types of incidents can be minimal or substantial. When challenges arise, we aim to prevent human, environmental, financial and reputational effects while maintaining production and distribution.
Our business continuity and emergency response planning includes creating realistic scenarios and guiding leadership teams through various exercises in order to learn, refine and improve our responses to actual incidents.
Our business continuity management framework is modeled after the ISO 22301 business continuity management standard, which helps us plan, implement, monitor and protect against business interruptions.
TI continuously monitors, plans and trains for both unanticipated and emerging operational risks, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, geopolitical issues, social unrest, terrorism, or supply-chain or product-distribution delays. Our internally owned and regionally diverse manufacturing footprint includes 11 wafer fabrication plants, seven assembly and test sites, and multiple bump and probe facilities across 15 sites worldwide. In addition to our internal capacity, we have strong partnerships with external foundries and subcontractor partners to offer supply continuity.
We mitigate disruptions to our business by continuously: • Monitoring risks, developing and modifying plans to address those risks, and training employees on crisis response.
• Assessing changes to environmental conditions, supply continuity, and the global regulatory and political landscape.
• Operating a 24/7 year-round security communication center.
• Owning much of our manufacturing to provide customers with a greater assurance of supply.
• Maintaining six months to two years of inventory for catalog products built ahead of demand and positioning the inventory globally at product distribution centers and hubs near customers’ manufacturing locations.
Responding to emergencies. 
Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, we activate our emergency response system. Our emergency response team assembles to quickly identify the appropriate resources, services and infrastructure required to mitigate potential losses and coordinate our response and communications.
Conducting business modeling, scenario and impact analysis to develop and refine management strategies, policies and standards, and contingency plans helps us determine: • Critical business processes that make up our operations and the people accountable for ensuring their viability.
• Possible threats and risks, and whether controls are in place to manage them.
• Process recovery times to ensure that we respond and recover efficiently and with the right resources.
• Contingency strategies for all critical business processes that pose a high risk to people, revenue and reputation.
• Comprehensive recovery strategies to cover all aspects of response and recovery, prioritizing the continuation of products and services.
Our Readiness 2 Recover program helps us measure the effectiveness of and compliance with our business continuity management requirements. Every two years (or as needed), we conduct risk assessments to identify and rectify existing controls and gaps. To engage our leaders in enterprise risk planning, we regularly: • Teach them how to assess and prioritize risks based on severity and potential impact on our people or products.
• Ask them to evaluate and update contingency strategies based on lessons learned from either real events or scenario-based exercises.
• Conduct drills, training, tabletop exercises and sitelevel exercises to prepare for unforeseen events.

Information protection. 
TI works continuously to identify and eliminate potential threats to its IT infrastructure, proprietary technologies and confidential information. This protection is key to business growth and profitability, and maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.
Reducing cybersecurity risks. 
Our cybersecurity risk management process is based on best practice management and governance frameworks, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology.
Using guidance from these organizations and information collected from our assessments, we develop cybersecurity plans, policies and protocols to reduce our risks and strengthen our security posture to protect our company, technology and intellectual property (IP). Our policies include defining the acceptable use of our information assets, access requirements for specific IP or technologies, protecting personal information and privacy, and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the China Cybersecurity Law.
Our global information security team identifies and responds to potential threats and works with our business units and support teams to improve security. As part of this, we take these types of actions:

Workforce representation. 
While there is always more work to do, the progress we’ve made regarding diversity and inclusion is encouraging. For decades, TI has remained committed to diversity and inclusion. As part of that ongoing commitment, we regularly assess our workforce relative to availability across gender, race and ethnic demographics to understand where we have gaps and where we need to place more emphasis to continue our progress toward having diverse representation at all levels.
Women and underrepresented minorities are not reflected in engineering majors and careers at the same levels as men and non-minorities. For this reason, we are focused on growing the engineering pipeline through partnerships with high schools, universities and nonprofit organizations.
17We define Other URMs (underrepresented minorities) as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, or two or more races. For more information, see our EEO-1 report. Any data differences less than 100% are attributable to a small percentage of undisclosed data.

Employee resource groups (ERGs)
For more than 30 years, the TI Diversity Network has helped educate employees and elevate topics that matter to employees through 15 employee-led ERGs that include thousands of members. The journey started in 1989 with the women’s and Hispanic/Latino/x ERGs. All TI ERGs have goals and objectives that align with and support our company values and business objectives. A team of employees lead each ERG, with at least one TI executive sponsor.
ERGs hosted hundreds of programs, panels and events in 2021 that engaged TIers in many ways. For example: • The Black Employee Network formed a Black Engineering Collective to support TIers who aspire to the TI Tech Ladder and build their technical leadership skills. They also hosted programs to build awareness about the significance of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Juneteenth and the impact of colorism.
• The Chinese Heritage Network collaborated with the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum to raise awareness and combat anti-Asian violence.
• The Pride network launched an on-demand course that provides TIers around the world foundational knowledge on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pronouns usage and important, and simple tips for promoting LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion as an ally.
For more information about how TI champions diversity and inclusion, see Diversity and Equal Opportunity in the GRI Index.
Conversations that matter. 
One of the ways that TI is co-creating an inclusive culture is through regular group-based dialogue teams with Catalyst, a global nonprofit that helps to build better workplaces for a diverse wokforce. The goal of these dialogue teams is to build selfawareness by learning to identify both personal and systemic barriers to inclusion, and how to interrupt exclusionary behaviors and challenge stereotypes. The sessions encourage candid, constructive dialogue with employees across all levels, from all backgrounds. In this way we are encouraging employees and leaders to share their experiences and bring their own courageous conversations to conference rooms across the company.
Our commitment to an inclusive environment. 
We are focused on reducing bias within our processes when interviewing candidates, reviewing job performance, and making compensation and advancement decisions by: • Requiring our hiring and development managers to complete unconscious bias training.
• Making unconscious bias content available in performance management workshops and directly to TIers through our learning and development system.
• Training leaders how to understand and recognize unconscious bias before conducting talent reviews. For example, leaders use specific and objective criteria to assess professional growth and gather independent feedback from multiple sources when assessing job performance.

Recruitment. 
TI’s ability to grow and thrive depends on recruiting and retaining the best talent in the industry. The company takes a multifaceted approach to hiring employees with diverse experiences and backgrounds to drive innovation and growth.
We actively engage and recruit top engineering and business students for internships and full-time positions through career fairs, information sessions, networking and career preparation events, and partnerships with various student associations.
We are focused on growing the diverse pipeline of talent through industry organizations. As an example: • We continue to grow the pipeline of female engineers and business leaders through partnerships with universities, our women’s ERG and industry organizations, such as the Society of Women Engineers.
• We also partner with veteran services offices at U.S. universities and two-year technical institutions, military bases, and organizations such as RecruitMilitary to hire skilled veterans.
Candidates choose TI because we offer: • Exciting and impactful work.
• The opportunity to collaborate with some of the world's smartest minds in technology.
• Competitive pay and benefits packages to help our employees live their best lives.
• Career development opportunities where employees feel empowered to own their career paths.
• An inclusive and diverse culture where all employees can be themselves and bring their best to work.
• Flexible work options to help TIers and their families get the most out of their personal life.
For more information about how TI manages recruitment, see indicator 401-1 and the Labor/Management Relations section in the GRI Index.
Liz, a planning manager in one of our 300-mm wafer fabs, was inspired to join the Army by her family who has been in the military for generations. After the Army, she interviewed at one of our wafer fabrication plants in Dallas. Liz reflected on how TI and the military have a similar way of approaching challenges: “Both focus on working the problem and relying on a team to create a solution. The military and TI have taught me about leadership and understanding that sometimes you have to put the needs and goals of your team ahead of yourself. As a TIer, veteran and working mom, I draw on the lessons I learned in the Army about integrity, duty, honor and respect. Those same qualities carried over into my role at TI.”

Early career. 
Recent college graduates can participate in: • Make an Impact, a yearlong program that enhances job performance and accelerates career growth using case studies, group projects and assessments, as well as boot camps that provide intensive training on tools, processes and fundamental skills.
• Global rotation programs that help graduates transition from student to professional and gain experience in various roles.
• Early career pivotal learning roles, which expose nominated employees to new roles or skill sets by working closely with leaders, technical experts and talent across TI. Since 2014, we promoted 30% of this program’s participants to management.
Development. 
We help employees set aspirational goals and create personal development plans to map the skills they need to succeed. We encourage all employees to discuss development and performance with their managers at least three times a year to receive feedback, document progress and determine any necessary refinements. Additionally, we offer formal learning and development opportunities at all levels to help every TIer – new and experienced – continuously evolve. Employees can access our internal hiring and learning platforms at any time to explore careers and chart development paths or complete mandatory training and other learning modules. A virtual format enabled TIers to complete nearly 44,500 courses in 2021. We customize learning opportunities to facilitate professional growth from internships to retirement.
Interns. 
Internships at TI provide an opportunity to put education into practice on interesting projects that matter. From day one, our interns receive hands-on, meaningful work that can make a real impact. Our internship program provides access to key leaders, and enables each to network and learn from TIers at all levels of the company.
Management. 
We equip TIers to succeed in management by: • Strengthening their leadership capability.
• Developing critical mindsets.
• Recognizing and reducing unconscious bias.
• Transitioning from leading a team of individuals to coaching managers.
• Moving into more complex roles by understanding their leadership impact, how to build relationships with key stakeholders, and how to create and communicate strategies.
Technical leaders. 
TI has tailored development to help engineers sharpen their technical abilities, share best practices, and develop soft skills such as leadership, communications and influence. Technical leaders can pursue election to TI’s prestigious Tech Ladder, which represents the top 24% of our technical leaders.

Accelerating the development of technical women. 
TI’s Women for Technical Leadership (WFTL) program provides coaching, formal training, roundtables and relationship-building opportunities to inspire a more diverse pool of talent for the Tech Ladder and to help retain, develop and move women into leadership roles. WFTL has helped increase the number women elected to TI’s Tech Ladder by nearly 50% since its formation in 2016.
“When Women for Technical Leadership was formed in 2016, we were seeing women participate in elections at roughly half the rate of men,“ said Yesenia Moore, vice president of diversity and inclusion. “We have seen marked improvement in the participation rates of women in the Tech Ladder election over the past five years. This is encouraging for progress yet to come.”
Amos Tang, a member of the 2021 cohort, was recently elected to the Tech Ladder and looks forward to inspiring other women to apply.
“The training sessions and roundtables with leadership gave me a new perspective as a technical leader,” she said. “This program is about self-confidence, how we express ourselves and how we connect with others. It also inspires us to continue mentoring and advocating to lead others to succeed.”
Kiki Schuck participated in WFTL and was elected to Tech Ladder early in her career. She said, “Participating in WFTL and being elected to the Tech Ladder helped me to find my voice and have more confidence. Having this recognition from my peers and being elected into this group of technologists gave me self-confidence as I approach new opportunities, solve problems and innovate.”

Compensation and benefits. 
We offer competitive compensation designed to ensure that our most talented employees, who will drive future growth, will remain at TI. Our compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance. Both the employee’s contribution to TI’s success and company performance determine an individual’s compensation.
One of the unique aspects of TI’s compensation strategy is a global profit-sharing program that rewards all TIers18 for contributions to the company’s financial success. TI makes payouts as a percentage of eligible earnings based on profitability each year.
Our profit-sharing formula is based on profit from operations (PFO) and begins when TI reaches 10% PFO. The maximum payout is 20%, when PFO reaches 35%. All TIers receive a payout based on the same percentage of eligible earnings. Our profit-sharing plan has paid out at the maximum level possible for the last six years, equating to a 20% bonus for all eligible employees. For more information about how TI manages compensation, see the Market Presence and Nondiscrimination sections and indicators 202-1, 405-1 and 405-5 in the GRI Index.
Our commitment to equitable pay. 
We pay our employees fairly and equitably. TI has had competitive and equitable compensation policies regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other protected characteristics, and we have designed checks and balances into our compensation system, including regular in-depth analyses, to ensure that we achieve it.
In 2021, we conducted a separate compensation analysis examining gender and race pay parity (including base, and bonus pay and equity), that considered job type, job level and country. Our analysis confirmed that within the U.S. and worldwide, TI pays women as much as men, and in the U.S., TI pays minorities as much as non-minorities.
18 Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-sharing programs. Employees receive bonuses in accordance with those requirements.
Competitive compensation and benefits. 
Retaining employees with institutional knowledge, technical and operating expertise, and relationships is a top priority for TI. We also recognize that retaining women and underrepresented minorities is critical.
TI takes a multidisciplinary approach to retention by offering: • Competitive pay and benefits.
• Tailored career development plans, mentoring programs and executive interaction to develop and encourage professional growth.
• Connection to peers through our ERGs.
• Unlimited opportunities to refine skills.

We also offer and encourage employees to take full advantage of various programs to reduce daily stressors that can interfere with well-being, workplace satisfaction and productivity, such as: • Flexible work arrangements.
• Concierge services for vacation planning, making reservations or other personal transactions.
• On-demand resources and referrals for child care and elder care through our Employee Assistance program.
• Confidential counseling sessions and tools to support well-being.
• Adoption support and reimbursement.
• Parental/maternity leave.
To refine work-life program offerings, we engage employees and audit our programs annually to remain competitive and improve services. In 2021, Glassdoor recognized TI in its annual Best Places to Work ranking for the company’s culture, atmosphere and great employees.

Safety and health. 
We believe that every workplace injury or illness is preventable, which is why we invest in and incorporate safe and healthy practices and controls into our employees’ daily routines.
ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING Safety. 
We have a safety-oriented culture that includes implementing safety requirements and best practices globally to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all of our employees. To maintain one of the industry’s best safety records, we: • Create and operate safe worksites.
• Maintain proper safety and ergonomic protocols and controls.
• Develop and maintain internal standards, which in many cases exceed regulatory requirements.
• Design and build inherently safe buildings and engineer out equipment risks.
• Require relevant safety training.
• Provide personal protective equipment.
• Inspect our equipment.
• Continuously audit our processes to assess compliance and performance.
Health. 
To reduce exposure to health risks, TI applies rigorous industrial hygiene standards that establish the minimum requirements necessary for the safe use and proper storage of hazardous chemicals and other materials. These standards include hazard communication and training, chemical labeling, and hazardous waste management.
Additionally, we eliminate or limit the use of potentially harmful materials, install ventilation and isolation controls, and conduct general hygiene and individual assessments.
The resources that we offer to TIers to take control of their health vary by country, depending on the extent of government health benefits available. In the U.S., we provide free on-site flu vaccines and preventive screening programs, fitness and nutrition programs, employee assistance programs, and counseling and education services.
Our health management service provides coaching and oversight to improve the well-being of TIers who have experienced a significant medical event; have extended work absences; or are dealing with multiple diagnoses, treatments and providers. Our benefit advocacy service helps estimate the costs of medical procedures and assists with locating affordable and quality health providers. For more information, see the Occupational Health and Safety section in the GRI Index.
Safety goals. 
We set safety goals that include a days away, restricted or job transfer (DART) case rate of 0.08 or less, and a recordable case rate of 0.20 or less.

We seek to improve the quality of life and strengthen our site communities across the globe. TI and the TI Foundation make well-considered and well-measured investments in several areas.
Education. 
TI targets its largest area of philanthropic giving at improving education. Since 2010, the TI Foundation has invested more than $50 million specifically in STEM education to improve math and science learning outcomes and opportunities for Black and Hispanic/ Latino(x) students in North Texas who historically face economic and educational barriers. Globally, we aim to improve access to educational resources in TI’s international site communities.
Human services. 
We aim to strengthen programs and services for critical needs among racially and economically marginalized populations. We also provide emergency funds for site communities and employees devastated by natural or human-caused disasters.
Racial equity. 
We support programs that dismantle barriers to racial equity, with an emphasis on police training and practices that reinforce accountability so that all people are policed equitably, and our communities are safer places to live and work.
Arts. 
We help sustain the arts that make Dallas culturally inclusive and vibrant through multi-year TI Foundation grants to organizations that emphasize the diversity their outreach efforts and programming, and through transformative grants to diverse groups that can become larger in scale and impact.
Giving. 
One of our three ambitions is to be a company that we’re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. For decades, TI has worked to build stronger communities where the company has operations.
Our giving and volunteering programs: 1. Engage TIers globally through giving campaigns and volunteering programs.
2. Improve our global communities through contributions to nonprofit organizations where TI operates.
3. Combine monetary investments with employee involvement for the greatest impact.

New TI Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building will advance patient care. 
With a $15 million donation from TI, the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern) are collaborating to create the new Texas Instruments Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building in Dallas. This $120 million research facility will accelerate collaboration between the two landmark institutions and the translation of biomedical technologies from ideas to treatment. The facility will enable UTD and UT Southwestern to leverage shared research strengths in basic and applied biomedical and engineering sciences to advance patient care.
“What were once two disparate fields – medicine and engineering – are now working together to make new discoveries about human life and health, and UTD and UT Southwestern are the ones doing it,” said Rich Templeton, TI’s chairman, president and CEO. “What gets me personally excited is that semiconductor technology is at the center of it.” 2021 giving highlights. 
Human services. 
We awarded grants to various agencies that provided emergency housing and services to unsheltered people in North Texas during severe winter storms. Outside of the U.S., TI and its employees helped fund hospital infrastructures and donated personal protection equipment to assist with COVID-19 relief efforts. For example: • Grants from TI, TIer donations and TI Foundation matching gifts totaling almost $1 million helped extend COVID-19 patient care at the Rajeev Gandhi Government Hospital’s Institute of Chest Diseases in Bangalore. This amount supplemented another $400,000 from TI for COVID-19 relief in India since the pandemic began in 2020.
• TI Taiwan provided front-line health care workers at Shuang-Ho Hospital with ventilators, N95 masks, non-woven fabric protection smocks, hair and shoe covers, face shields and gloves at a value of approximately $125,000.
• TIers in Germany collected donations for the St. Klara Children’s Home Christmas Appeal, held a charity run for a program supporting children with cancer - raising nearly $11,000; and raised almost $27,000 in disaster relief and volunteered to help rebuild bridges after historic flooding devastated parts of Europe.
Racial equity. 
The TI Foundation granted $2 million to the University of North Texas at Dallas to create the Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) Project Center of Excellence at the Caruth Police Institute. ABLE provides peer-intervention training for police officers to handle situations safely before they escalate by equipping them with the skills and support they need to address daily and often stressful law enforcement challenges.
 

Arts. 
The TI Foundation awarded $1.5 million in grants to Dallas arts organizations, including $575,000 to organizations that reflect the diversity of Dallas’ neighborhoods and visitors and bring cultural and racial diversity to their programming. Funding also included support for the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum for programming that confronted anti-Asian hate and bigotry.
Education. 
TI and the TI Foundation made $27.9 million in education grants and matched nearly $3.8 million in employee and retiree donations toward education. The TI Foundation continued supporting public school districts in southern Dallas County, as the COVID-19 pandemic widened economic and educational gaps for students and families in an area where more than one-third of residents live in poverty.

To double the impact of U.S. employee giving, the TI Foundation matches TIer and retiree donations up to $30,000 per year to eligible nonprofit organizations. In 2021, the TI Foundation provided nearly $11.2 million in matching gifts.
*The TI Foundation is our company’s 501(c)(3) philanthropic organization. It makes grants primarily in North Texas, and the U.S.
Improving the lives of our neighbors. 
The annual United Way campaign is a cornerstone of our company giving and volunteering efforts. In 2021, we gave the nonprofit $6.8 million through more than 4,000 TIer and retiree donations, company sponsorships and TI Foundation grants and matching gifts.
In North Texas, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas plays a significant role in creating lasting change through programs that ensure all of our neighbors have access to education, income and health – the building blocks of opportunity. Together with its partner agencies, United Way works hard to bring about lasting change to improve the lives of neighbors suffering from such disparities as loss of income, food insecurity and a lack of health care.

After historic flooding devastated parts of Europe in July 2021, employees from our Freising site came together quickly to help their neighbors by raising relief funds, building temporary infrastructure and providing calculators to students who lost theirs in the flooding. Their actions embody our commitment to building – and sometimes rebuilding – stronger communities.
Additionally, TIers in Freising who volunteer with Germany’s Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) provided on-site assistance – together with THW specialist groups – to build a bridge over the Ahr River as a temporary replacement for an original bridge that was swept away during the flooding. Constructing the temporary bridge was a crucial step in getting communities in the area moving again, allowing relief and infrastructure efforts to reach them.
Our employees have a passion for giving back and improving the quality of life in their communities. TI has more than 20 global community involvement teams and other civic-minded employees who work hard to solve local needs. Together, they mentor STEM students, coach robotics competitions, volunteer at food banks and homeless shelters, clean up parks, plant trees and give valuable time to serve their communities in other ways.
2021 contributions. 
Despite limited in-person opportunities because of the pandemic, TIers donated 119,547 hours of their time at a value23 of $3.6 million. In the U.S., the TI Foundation matches the value of employees’ volunteer hours up to $1,000 per year, which added $357,088 of additional support for their favorite causes.
While precautions due to COVID-19 drove how and where TIers gave their time and talent, the pandemic did not change why they did so – to build stronger communities. For example, employees and community involvement teams from: • U.S. sites participated in virtual volunteering projects to support United Way nonprofit partner agencies in their efforts to fight poverty, hunger and financial insecurity.
• Dallas, the Philippines, Japan and Malaysia held food drives and distributed food to needy families.
• Germany, Dallas and the Philippines virtually mentored and tutored students and showed them what it’s like to be an engineer at TI.
• Europe and Asia addressed environmental concerns and helped clean up parks and neighborhoods during World Cleanup Day.
• Human resources partnered with Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas to support the organization’s increased emphasis on diversity and inclusion with three skills-based volunteering projects focused on recruiting, onboarding and employee engagement.

Global week of impact. 
TI’s employee-led community involvement teams joined together during the holiday season, focused on gratitude and giving, to volunteer and give back to build stronger communities. Across the globe, they expressed thanks to those who keep us healthy and safe, and made life a little easier for those facing hardships, helping our neighbors in areas many of us take for granted.
Essential workers at hospital systems and fire stations in northern California and in Dallas, Texas, were shown appreciation through meals, thank you notes and goody bags for the “superhero” efforts they made throughout the year to keep our communities safe and healthy.
Global volunteering efforts focused on our most vulnerable neighbors -- children, the elderly, the hungry and the unsheltered. TIers worked with local partners to ensure that hundreds of children and young adults in Germany, the Philippines, Texas and Utah received gifts, books and meals. Senior citizens in Portland, Maine, and Sugarland, Texas, received basic home and hygiene items and notes of encouragement from our employees.
In Japan, teams collected food items for food-insecure families near our Miho manufacturing site. In Sherman, Texas, TIers fulfilled wish-list items for local charities who work with previously incarcerated youth and victims of domestic abuse. And in Tucson and Dallas, TIers and their families transformed more than 600 rocks into messages of kindness and encouragement for schools and homeless shelters.

Global Reporting Initiative. 
TI developed its Corporate Citizenship Report using the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards as guidance. This index contains general and specific environmental, social and governance (ESG) standard responses, which includes information that is not material to TI, but may be considered important to TI and our stakeholders.
General responses. 
Indicator Description Response 102-1 Name of the organization Our company name is Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN).
102-2 Activities, brands, products and services To learn more about TI’s products, see SEC form 10-K, Part I, pages 3-4.
102-3 Location of headquarters TI’s headquarters are located at 12500 TI Blvd., Dallas, TX 75243.
102-4 Location of operations See the global map on the TI at a Glance section of our website.
102-5 Ownership and legal form For information about TI’s ownership structure, see SEC form 10-K, Part I.

Indicator Description Response 102-8 Number of employees and workers by age, gender and type. 
See employee data in the Workplace section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. TI does not track the number of employees by employment contract and its part-time workforce is negligible. Full-time employees perform the majority of work and are supported by supplemental contractors when needed (supplemental contractors receive daily work instruction from TI managers). The number of these contractors varies throughout the year.
102-9 Supply-chain description. 
See the Supply-Chain Responsibility section in TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, Anti-Human Trafficking Statement and our supplier website for more information about our supply chain. We spend roughly 80% of procurement dollars with approximately 300 suppliers, of which about 180 are critical to supporting semiconductor manufacturing. We define “critical suppliers” as those essential to the supply strategy of a category procurement team that could cause a major disruption to be manufacturing or design output. When needed, we outsource the manufacturing of wafers or product assembly and testing.
102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain. 
Over the past several years, we have invested in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. For example, in 2021, about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online.
Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. For more information, see SEC form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 6-7.
102-11 Precautionary principle or approach TI applies precautionary principles in many aspects of its operations to reduce or avoid negative environmental impacts where scientific evidence is insufficient or uncertain. For example, our aggressive chemical and material screening process assures that we do not use materials whose hazards are not fully understood and may not be fully controllable.
102-12 External initiatives. 
TI’s governance documents guide its business practices, which apply to all sites worldwide and evolve based on changing business needs. We also voluntarily subscribe to industry and international standards to improve our ESG performance. These include: • The International Organization for Standardization (ISO). • The GRI reporting framework to measure and report our citizenship progress. • The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to improve and increase reporting of climate-related impacts. • The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to disclose the financial impacts of sustainability. • The Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), which has a specific code of conduct to help ensure worker safety, protection, fairness, environmental responsibility and business efficiency in the electronics industry. • The U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Green Building Rating System to design and operate efficient and low-impact manufacturing facilities. • The CDP, which helps investors, companies and cities act to build a sustainable economy.

Indicator Description Response 102-13 Membership of associations. 
TI belongs to many associations with which it works on various policy objectives. We are more active in some organizations than others and do not work on all association issues. We may not align on all positions. We also collaborate with other outside groups and coalitions, such as the RBA and Semiconductor Industry Association, to advance policies that drive growth; promote competitiveness; and support our shareholders, customers, employees and the communities in which we operate.
102-14 Statement from senior decision-maker See the CEO letter in TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to read about our commitment to citizenship and sustainability.
102-16 Values, principles, standards and norms of behavior. 
TI’s policy is to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We published our first ethics guide in 1961, which is a historic foundation of our business practices. In our Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct, we describe our: • Ambitions: what we desire and are determined to achieve. • Values: principles that define who we are and how we behave. • Code of conduct: standards we commit to uphold. • Policies: rules to govern our decisions and behavior.
A core group of leaders developed Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct, while TI’s management committee and executive officers provided oversight, input and direction. The TI board of directors approved the directive and Rich Templeton, TI chairman, president and CEO, signed. This document is available in multiple languages. All TI leaders are accountable for conducting business according to the code.
Responsibility for Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct begins with Chairman, President and CEO Rich Templeton and our board of directors. Leaders at every company level are accountable for modeling our ambitions and values, upholding Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct and holding their organizations accountable. Our chief compliance officer, senior vice president of human resources, and ethics and compliance directors collaborate with other stakeholders to oversee and coordinate ethics and compliance programs across TI. They periodically share updates and results with the board of directors’ Audit Committee, senior managers and other executives to drive continuous and effective improvement.
TIers are encouraged to raise questions or concerns about conduct that may be inconsistent with Living our values. TI will not tolerate retaliation against those who have reported an issue in good faith. Anyone who retaliates against an employee for these activities is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.
102-18 Governance structure Read more about TI’s governance structure, roles and responsibilities on the Governance overview web page and Board Oversight of ESG Matters. For board diversity data, see the Governance section in TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report.

Indicator Description Response 102-30 Effectiveness of risk-management processes. 
See the Risk Management and Business Continuity section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for more information about TI’s risk management and business continuity practices.
Governance TI takes a holistic approach to risk management to build a culture that minimizes risk exposures and protects shareholder value. TI’s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for financial risk (accounting, finance, internal controls and tax strategy). Our board of directors’ committees share oversight responsibility for compliance risk.
TI also has a Business Continuity steering team that oversees its business continuity strategy, policy, program and plans. Team members meet regularly to discuss risks, best practices and implementation plans and take a lead role if disruptive events occur. They also provide an annual update to the chief financial officer.
Monitoring risks All TI organizations and teams are expected to identify potential risks to employees, business practices, the supply chain and the environment. They conduct formal risk assessments and invest in controls that benefit our company, customers and communities. We then validate and monitor findings until actions are complete. Each quarter, we report risks and mitigation plans to senior managers. We also annually disclose risks in SEC form 10-K.
Grievance channels Stakeholders can contact ti.com/support or their account managers with any risk-related questions, concerns or grievances.
102-40 List of stakeholder groups TI’s stakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, communities where we have operations, academia, public officials, trade associations, regulatory agencies, nongovernmental organizations, analysts, suppliers, contractors, TI retirees and potential employees.
102-41 Collective bargaining agreements Employees at our global operations have always had the freedom to associate and the right to collective bargaining as provided by local statutes; therefore, we do not track the percentage of employees covered by such agreements.
102-42 Identifying and selecting stakeholders We engage with stakeholders who directly influence or are interested in our operations.
102-43 Approach to stakeholder engagement. 
We tailor our dynamic engagement strategies, methodologies and communications to the unique interests of the people and organizations that directly influence or have an interest in our operations. Engagement mechanisms generally include meetings, calls and emails and vary in frequency. Our senior leaders regularly share stakeholder feedback on ESG matters with the executive team and board of directors.
Stakeholders can ask questions or share opinions through our website (TI.com), email address (citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com) and social media channels. We have an accounting and audit hotline for addressing accounting- and audit-related topics and relate all inquiries received on the hotline to the Audit Committee chair of our board of directors.

Indicator Description Response 102-44 Key topics and concerns raised Through informal engagement with stakeholders in 2021, we learned that their top questions or issues were greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy and goal setting, addressing environmental-related risks, renewable energy goals, water conservation, labor and human rights, and employee experience including compensation, recruitment and retention.
102-45 Entities included in consolidated financial statements TI has two reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other (see SEC form 10-K, Part I, Item 1, pages 2-4). TI’s Corporate Citizenship Report covers ESG topics for all TI-owned entities and facilities included in our financial statements.
102-46 Defining report content and topic boundaries We solicit input from internal and external stakeholders throughout the year through regular engagement. We also examine third-party sustainability assessments and benchmark disclosure trends and best practices. We then compare these inputs to our company priorities to determine what topics and disclosures to include in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.
102-47 List of material topics. 
Following the release of TI’s 2020 Corporate Citizenship Report, we conducted extensive peer, customer and competitor benchmarking to determine where we should consider updating disclosures to support the work we are doing on environmental, social, and governance topics. We also met with leaders to review opportunities and discussion topics for our 2021 report. Those discussions led to including the following topics and some expanded disclosures in our 2021 report. These topics may include additional disclosures not related to material topics in some instances. • Business continuity and risk management. • Environmental impact (air and greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and use of renewable sources, and water and wastewater). • Materials and chemical management. • Volunteering and giving. • Workplace (diversity and inclusion, recruitment and retention, development, compensation, and employee health and safety). • Supply-chain responsibility (including labor and human rights and conflict minerals). • Ethics. • Public policy.
102-48 Restatements of information We included any restatements of information in footnotes within TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report.
102-49 Changes in reporting TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report tells the company’s citizenship story and elaborates on goals and progress in key focus areas. It is aligned with the GRI, TCFD and SASB frameworks.

Indicator Description Response 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans. 
TI has various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree healthcare benefits. Contributions to these plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. See SEC form 10-K, Item 8, Note 7, pages 42-47: Post Retirement Benefit Plans.
For all U.S. employees (those who choose to opt into and contribute to a 401(k), we match 100% of their contributions, up to 4% of annual eligible earnings. We match half of that for employees who also contribute to our pension plan. Also, eligible and highly compensated employees can defer a portion of their base pay, year-end bonus and profit-sharing. We offer a global profit-sharing program that rewards all eligible TIers for contributing to our financial success. Some countries, such as France and Mexico, have statutory requirements for their local profit-sharing programs, which we meet.
201-4 Financial assistance received from the government TI receives tax-benefit incentives from federal, state and local governments worldwide. These incentives are commonly available to manufacturing companies with investments in equipment and facilities, employment, and R&D.

Codes of conduct TI suppliers must adhere to TI’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which uses the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) code of conduct as its foundation and includes environmental standards specifically applicable to TI’s suppliers.
Engagement When initiating relationships with suppliers, we educate them about our standards and expectations for safe, humane and ethical labor practices, as well as human trafficking, forced labor and workers’ rights. We communicate these guidelines in meetings; on our supplier website; and in purchase orders, supplier contracts and other related documents. We also routinely engage and collaborate with industry groups such as the RBA, the Semiconductor Industry Association, and Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International to discuss and create supply-chain standards and share best management practices.
Training We deliver online and in-person training on our Supplier Code of Conduct, standards and expectations. We also leverage RBA’s training programs to help suppliers understand the alliance’s code of conduct, labor risks, respecting workers’ rights, hiring migrant workers and more.
Conflict minerals TI is an early member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), created by RBA/Global E-Sustainability Initiative members, that works to advance effective policies that address conflict mineral concerns. TI works diligently with our supply chain, including subcontracted manufacturers, to identify and eliminate noncompliant sources of material.
Grievance mechanisms TI has established grievance mechanisms to ensure that its buyers or procurement representatives meet with suppliers to address any questions or concerns. Our Supply-Chain Management team can also assist with identifying and addressing issues inconsistent with our ethics and values. If suppliers (or employees or contractors of suppliers) prefer, they can contact our Ethics Office to ask questions or discuss issues anonymously.
Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to establish and maintain programs that ensure the confidentiality, anonymity and protection of supplier and employee whistleblowers unless prohibited by law. Suppliers must have a communicated process for their personnel to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation.
Resources TI allocates extensive financial, human, training, information and engagement resources to help suppliers understand its policies and expectations, roles and responsibilities, performance and ethics expectations, and environmental, safety and health (ESH) and labor protections.
204-2 24 The proportion of spending on U.S. minority- and women-owned enterprises In 2021, our percentage of spending with diverse suppliers was 20.3%, and included both contracts related to day-to-day operations and as well as our capacity expansion in Richardson, Texas. Excluding the contracts related to Richardson expansion, our spending percentage would have been 8.8%.

See the Ethics, Compliance and Code of Conduct section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct to learn more about our management approach to anti-corruption. We assess all manufacturing sites for corruption and ethics risks annually using the RBA’s self-assessment tools. Additionally, we leverage an industry-leading anti-corruption and third-party management system to assess our external engagements.
205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption. 
TI’s anti-corruption compliance program assesses its worldwide operations and suppliers for risks related to corruption. TI operates in China, India, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines and Russia/Eastern Europe, which are considered at higher risk for corruption. However, the semiconductor industry is relatively low risk compared to construction, extractive or other industries where conducting business requires considerable interaction with government officials. We have policies in place and conduct focused training for certain high-risk countries and functions to address and mitigate these risks.
205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures. 
TI provides ethics and compliance awareness training that includes anti-corruption topics to all employees, select suppliers and third parties. Additionally, our anti-corruption policy and code of conduct are available to all employees and translated into multiple languages. We periodically assess and revise training programs and related efforts to reflect legal changes and support continuous compliance improvement.
205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken TI investigates all reports for review and action. In the event of any confirmed incidents, we would take appropriate remedial actions. For confidentiality reasons, we do not publicly report the number or nature of such incidents.

Environment standards – ESH. 
Indicator Description Response 103-1 to 103-3 Disclosure of management approach. 
See the Environmental Sustainability section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and the associated ESH indicators in this GRI Index to learn more about how TI manages ESH.
Governance See Board Oversight of ESG Matters.
Management system Our ESH management system facilitates the planning, execution, evaluation and management oversight of activities and strategies. It meets certification requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 (environmental management system criteria) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management system criteria). Our management system also contains programs, policies, controls, processes and measurement tools based on industry best practices and international standards. It helps us mitigate risks, improve our performance, fulfill compliance obligations and achieve our objectives. Programs include extensive chemical and material screening, material sourcing, waste profiling, emissions management, and responsible recycling and disposal. We require 100% of our employees and supplemental contractors at all TI manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to management system requirements. Other personnel not managed by TI are responsible for following their companies’ ESH management procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.
Goals TI sets company wide and/or site-specific GHG emission reduction, landfill diversion, water conservation and energy reduction goals. We track and report the effectiveness of these initiatives to senior leaders quarterly.
Policies TI’s ESH Policy is available in multiple languages: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Spanish, German and Korean. TI’s Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct also includes sections on protecting human health and the environment.
Engagement We evaluate the potential positive and negative impacts of a proposed project on a community by conducting environmental impact assessments before site selection.
Assessment To ensure that our internal management system is effective, the Worldwide ESH Compliance Support team and independent third parties perform audits at each facility every three years; in interim years, the facilities perform self-assessments. They examine compliance with legal and TI standards and training effectiveness. Additionally, we: • Survey employees and external stakeholders. • Conduct legally required inspections and monitor incident rates. • Benchmark against the RBA’s self-assessment disclosure and its code of conduct and against peers and members of the Semiconductor Industry Association. • Have select sites third-party audited under the RBA’s Validated Audit Process.
We communicate gaps and best practices to other sites so that similar issues will not occur. Each manufacturing site also reports performance using a scorecard that measures energy use, water efficiency and landfill diversion. We share scorecards internally for transparency and best-practice awareness and as an accountability mechanism. We have not made significant adjustments to our corporate-level ESH management system because of audit findings.
Grievance channels We offer several channels through which internal and external stakeholders can submit ESH questions, concerns or grievances. All employees and supplemental contractors have “stop work” authority to remove themselves from work situations that they believe could cause injury, illness or environmental harm. They also can contact their supervisor, site ESH staff or anonymously contact the TI Ethics Office. Customers can contact ti.com/support or direct all other ESH-related inquiries to citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com.
Resources TI allocates extensive financial, human, training and communication resources to help TIers monitor and control potential ESH impacts, protect employee health and safety, understand specific ESH roles and responsibilities and drive improvements. We provide our ESH team with extensive training and tools to implement appropriate industry best practices and comply with regulatory requirements. To guide these efforts, we require employees and supplemental contractors at all manufacturing and assembly/test sites to adhere to our ESH Policy and Principles.

Environment standards – Energy. 
Indicator Description Response 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization See the Energy section in TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. TI does not sell any energy outside of the company.
302-3 Energy intensity. 
See the Energy section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. Our 2021 energy intensity ratio was 0.30. We divide the total energy consumption by the number of wafer chips (not including external manufacturing) produced each year when calculating energy intensity. We then compare this to a 2005 base year to report a ratio based only on internal energy consumption. The energy types included in the ratio are natural gas, gasoline, diesel, electricity, propane, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas and district heating.
302-4 Reduction of energy consumption. 
See the Energy section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for reduction data. Energy conservation savings are based on electricity, fuel and heating projects. The basis for calculation is the estimated annualized reduction for each project, with the total reported as the sum of all annualized savings estimates. We validate energy conservation savings for capital investments over $50,000 by taking additional pre- and post-project consumption measurements.
302-5 Reductions in energy requirements of products and services TI does not have data collection processes to track, record and report this information exactly this way.
Environment standards – Water. 
Indicator Description Response 103-1 to 103-3 Disclosure of management approach. 
See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this GRI Index and TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about water management. TI’s global ESH water-management standard outlines requirements of wastewater programs, sewage treatment programs, stormwater pollution prevention and water reduction activities at each site.
Additionally, we: • Visually inspect our onsite wastewater treatment plants regularly to ensure they operate properly and do not leak. • Periodically clean the plants and inspect the treatment basins for integrity. • Hire trained or certified operators as required.
We calculate consumption data from water utility bills at sites that we financially control and that are larger than 50,000 square feet. Each year, we voluntarily report our water footprint to the CDP and in this report.
Water sources Our water sources include surface water from local municipal supplies and groundwater. Our water footprint comprises three types of water: • Nonmanufacturing – used in restrooms, irrigation, drinking fountains and cafeterias. • Manufacturing – used to rinse wafers after chemical processing or for other fabrication processes. • Manufacturing support – used in exhaust abatement and cooling systems.

Indicator Description Response 303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource. 
There have not been water impacts directly attributed to discharges and runoff at any TI site. We sustain this by maintaining compliance with discharge limits in our permits, following TI standards, and ensuring that sites follow good housekeeping practices and actively collaborate to continuously improve and minimize exposure to water pathways. See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about how TI interacts with water and collaborates with stakeholders regarding this shared resource.
All of TI’s main manufacturing and assembly/test facilities set annual water reduction goals based on projects they identified as part of the company’s ongoing energy and water reduction program. Sites decide which projects to pursue based on various factors, including economic payback and impact on process system stability and reliability. Public policy and water stress factor into these decisions indirectly. Public policy and water stress impact the cost and availability of water, making water reductions more attractive from a financial standpoint or if they are necessary for system reliability.
303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts. 
See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2022 CDP Water Security response to learn more about wastewater management. Local regulatory agencies set minimum quality standards for effluents, which all TI sites manage to permissible limits. Some regulators incorporate sector-specific standards to set their requirements.
Our internal water-management standard includes guidelines that ensure compliance with wastewater, stormwater and sewage discharge permits and other requirements. Sites monitor water quality and have procedures to manage spills or other abnormalities. We report wastewater discharges and the portion of total water discharged through regulated wastewater treatment points to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies.
303-3 Water withdrawal See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for water withdrawal data. Municipal sources and groundwater supply our water. We calculate consumption from sites TI fully controls and that are larger than 50,000 square feet.
303-4 Total water discharge and priority discharges of concern for which discharges are treated. 
Federal, state or local regulators create wastewater permits that define and determine priority substances that must meet discharge limits. We comply with these limits by treating water in onsite treatment plants, separating concentrated metals and solvents from waste streams, and other measures. See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for discharge data.
TI participates in several industry workgroups to anticipate substances that government entities may regulate in the future. Together, we research and assess data of chemicals used in production using both standard sampling methodologies and analytical methods and those developed by member companies.
303-5 Water consumption and storage. 
See the Water Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for consumption and storage data. We calculate consumption data from total water usage and site-specific factors, such as evaporation, irrigation, boiler use or cooling tower use. We verify this data by examining site water balances and discharge flow rates from our wastewater and sewage treatment systems. TI reports water usage data to local, state, federal and international regulatory agencies.

Environment standards – Biodiversity. 
Indicator Description Response 304-1 Operational sites owned, leased, managed in, or adjacent to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas. 
TI’s worldwide semiconductor design, manufacturing and assembly/test sites are located in industrial areas, inner-city areas, suburban areas and areas surrounded by agricultural farmlands. One 69-acre fabrication site in South Portland, Maine, is located in the Long Creek Watershed Management District. TI complies with state and federal regulations protecting this terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem. Other TI sites also adhere to rigorous air emission, water and wastewater goals, and requirements to manage the company’s impact on biodiversity.
We contribute to biodiversity by planting indigenous trees where we have sites and participating in community cleanup events in locations worldwide.
Environment standards – Emissions. 
Indicator Description Response 103-1 to 103-3 Disclosure of management approach. 
See the Air Emissions and GHG Emissions sections of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report, ESH Disclosure of Management Approach in this GRI Index and TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response to learn more about how we manage emissions.
We conduct routine monitoring and audits to comply with air quality and GHG emission regulations and reporting requirements that vary by country, state and municipality. We must report U.S. GHG emissions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to comply with its mandatory reporting requirements. The EPA requires that the semiconductor industry (among other industries) measure and report annual fluorinated GHG emissions (such as sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons [PFCs] and hydrochlorofluorocarbons) as well as GHG emissions from combustion sources. We also voluntarily report our GHG emissions data to the World Semiconductor Council (as part of the U.S. industry report), the CDP and in our annual Corporate Citizenship Report.
TI reports U.S. air emissions data to federal and state regulators. We also report chemical releases and pollution prevention activities to the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory.
Boundaries We measure scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from TI-owned and leased sites larger than 50,000 square feet. This accounts for 97% of our total square footage and more than 99% of our equivalent carbon dioxide emissions. We do not report data from subcontractors, supplier manufacturing facilities or facilities smaller than 50,000 square feet.
305-1 Direct (scope 1) GHG emissions. 
See the GHG Emissions section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for scope 1 data. The gases included in our data calculations include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
We calculate scope 1 GHG emissions using relevant guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting Rule and published emission factors. Our methodology includes accepted quantification methods, emission factors and global warming potential. For more information, see TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response.

Indicator Description Response 305-2 Energy indirect (scope 2) GHG emissions. 
See the GHG Emissions section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for scope 2 data and our response to indicator 305-1. The gases included in our data calculations include CO2 , CH4 and N2O. We have not made any significant emissions changes that triggered base-year emissions recalculations.
The EPA’s GHG Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Requirements (MRR) Final Rule is our source of the emissions factors and global warming potential rates. Scope 2 location-based electricity emission factors are from the U.S. EPA eGRID for U.S. sites and the International Energy Agency for all international sites. Scope 2 marketbased factors are Green E residual mix for U.S. locations and AIB Residual mix for our Freising location. All calculations for scope 2 emissions follow either U.S. EPA MMR or IPCC Tier 2 requirements. For more information, see TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response.
305-4 GHG emissions intensity Our normalized GHG emissions intensity ratio in 2021 was 0.27. The ratio equals the emissions intensity in 2021 divided by the emissions intensity in 2005. We calculate the intensity using both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3 as the numerator and the number of chips produced within TI as the denominator.
305-5 Reduction of GHGs TI’s normalized scope 1 and scope 2 emissions were down by 12.9% from 2020 to 2021. See the GHG Emissions section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report and TI’s 2022 CDP Climate Change response for more information about emission reductions.
305-6 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs)
See the Waste and Material Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for more information about ODSs. TI does not allow the use of Class I and Class II ODSs, except in closed-loop refrigeration systems if the refrigeration system equipment was purchased or acquired before the ODS refrigerant’s elimination date. We do store some refrigerant gases for maintaining refrigeration systems for our chillers.
305-7 Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and other significant air emissions See the Air Emissions section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for U.S. air emissions data.

306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts. 
TI applies a three-step approach to waste and materials management: examine what we need, reuse what we can and recycle what is allowed. Most of the materials we need are for fabricating semiconductors. When purchasing materials and chemicals, we consider the resulting waste and whether an opportunity exists to reuse existing materials, purchase recycled materials or use environmentally friendly items instead. See the Waste and Materials Management section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report for information on our waste diversion goal and activities.
We also follow strict standards and protocols for responsibly purchasing, transporting, tracking and disposing of chemicals safely. We have an established process to review, assess and select waste management facilities according to legal requirements. Each TI site is responsible for monitoring and collecting waste data.

404-2 Programs for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programs. 
Employees take part in a variety of development opportunities throughout their careers. See the Development section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report. If workforce reductions occur, we make every effort to transfer impacted employees to other open positions within TI. When transfers are not possible, we provide severance packages that include resume and job search assistance.
404-3 Percentage of employees receiving performance development reviews. 
TI supports employees owning their careers, which includes three main components: performing in your current role, developing your capability and planning your career. We encourage goal-setting at the beginning of each year, including performance and development goals and formal performance reviews twice a year to confirm employees understand their own goals and manager expectations. We do not track the number of employees receiving performance reviews. We have seen greater success in employee engagement, goal-setting and alignment with our priorities by encouraging better conversations between supervisors and employees. We provide access to online resources to guide these conversations. We also host workshops on setting goals, reviewing performance, development planning, engaging and retaining talent, and career planning.

Governance The Audit Committee of our board of directors oversees human and labor rights-related efforts and receives annual updates. If a serious violation occurs, we promptly notify the committee chair.
Assessment We require all worldwide manufacturing sites to complete third-party self-assessment questionnaires annually, focusing on human rights practices. TI and third-party auditors also assess select sites for human rights risks. We use our business practices statement and TI code of conduct and our membership in organizations such as the RBA as reference points for our approach to managing human rights issues.
Policies and practices We have: • Nondiscrimination, workplace safety, anti-human trafficking, working hours and minimum wages and data privacy policies. Additional policies guide our actions in specific areas, such as supply chain, environmental protection, health and safety, and privacy. • Several operating procedures to safeguard employees, suppliers and contractors’ rights, including labor standards, training and awareness-building practices, freedom to associate and incident reporting tools.

We provide training modules related to human rights, ethics, compliance, integrity and respect in the workplace, cross-cultural awareness and bullying to help managers, security personnel and TIers worldwide – including those in higher-risk countries where we operate – to maintain a respectful, humane and nondiscriminatory workplace. All TI sites must build awareness of human rights among employees, identify risks, and put management processes in place. Noncompliance with our standards and related labor laws will result in corrective actions.
The Living our values – TI’s ambitions, values and code of conduct document address human rights and the methods for reporting any concerns for all employees globally.

Resources TI allocates extensive financial and human resources to help employees share their time, money and expertise to build stronger communities.
413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments and development programs. 
TI does not conduct formal community impact assessments because our sites are in existing industrial areas that do not negatively impact vulnerable populations. We assess environmental impacts and risks at all sites. We also engage with community leaders to identify local needs so that we may support them through corporate, TI Foundation and employee giving or by providing volunteers (see the Giving and Volunteering section of TI’s 2021 Corporate Citizenship Report to learn more).
Stakeholders with questions or concerns about our community, philanthropy and volunteering programs can email citizenshipfeedback@list.ti.com or contact the TI Ethics Office anonymously.
413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts on local communities. 
TI announced in January 2020 the closure of two 150-mm wafer production sites in North Texas over the next three to five years. The closure of the fabrication site in Sherman, Texas, (SFAB) will be completed no earlier than 2024 and no later than 2025; however, the site in Dallas, Texas, (DFAB) will not close as previously announced. It will remain open with a smaller set of technologies.
SFAB is more than 50 years old. SFAB team members have been an important part of TI’s overall success and continue to be critical in helping ensure a successful transition. Once we get to a later stage towards closure, we expect to offer many employees jobs in our other North Texas manufacturing sites, for example as part of the newly announced fabs in Sherman, our factory expansion in Richardson, Texas, or at other manufacturing sites in the Dallas area.
We also continue to expand operations in several communities across North Texas; Lehi, Utah; China; and Malaysia. These include: • Construction of our next 300-mm wafer fab in Richardson, Texas, which should be able to contribute output starting in 2022. • Our recently completed acquisition of a 300-mm wafer in Lehi, Utah, which should be able to contribute output starting in early 2023. • Construction of new 300-millimeter wafer fabs in Sherman, Texas, which have the potential for up to four fabs to meet demand over time. • Our second assembly/test facility on our existing site in Chengdu, China.
